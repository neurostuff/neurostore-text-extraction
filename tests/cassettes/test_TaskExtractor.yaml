      seen as instrumentally abusive and emotionally callous, yet social challenges
      often trigger uncontrolled emotional behavior in those individuals. This study
      shows how this paradoxical aspect of psychopathy relates to altered neuroendocrine
      interactions between testosterone and the cerebral circuit coordinating emotional
      action tendencies. The anterior prefrontal cortex, a region necessary for controlling
      emotional behavior, showed blunted responses and reduced connectivity with the
      amygdala in psychopathic criminals engaged in controlling their emotional action
      tendencies. This cerebral pattern was strongest in psychopathic individuals
      with high endogenous testosterone levels. This neuroendocrine signature of altered
      emotional control highlights the relevance of considering the testosterone level
      of individual psychopathic patients during treatment of their impulsive behavior.
      \\n\\n\\n## Introduction \\n  \\nPsychopathy is a disorder often associated
      with blunted emotional responding and increased goal-directed behavior ( ;  ).
      On the other hand, offenders with psychopathy also show a paradoxical increase
      in impulsive behavior and uncontrolled aggression after emotional provocations
      ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), which may be related to heightened testosterone levels (
      ;  ). These two aspects of psychopathy are also distinguished within the most
      commonly used psychopathy checklist, the Psychopathy Check List-Revised (PCL-R),
      potentially reflecting differing traits among psychopathic individuals ( ;  ).
      Importantly, enhanced difficulty in controlling emotional impulses, a crucial
      component of criminal psychopathy associated with PCL-R factor 2, has been largely
      neglected by cognitive neuroscience. Yet, the clinical relevance of this cognitive
      trait is large: reduced behavioral control and increased impulsivity predict
      recidivism in psychopathic offenders ( ), and behavioral control in psychopathic
      offenders appears particularly fragile when dealing with emotionally relevant
      behavior ( ;  , chapter 7;  ). Accordingly, understanding the neurobiological
      systems underlying the altered control of social emotional behavior in psychopathic
      individuals is relevant for improving currently available interventions, which
      are plagued by low treatment response and high recidivism ( ). Here we study
      those neuroendocrine systems in a group of psychopathic offenders engaged in
      an experimental paradigm that requires rule-driven control of emotional behavior.
      \\n\\nPrevious investigations of psychopathy showed altered reactivity to emotional
      material in several brain regions that include the anterior part of the PFC
      (aPFC) and the amygdala ( ;  ;  ). Furthermore, individuals with psychopathy
      showed decreased functional and anatomical connectivity between the PFC and
      amygdala at rest ( ;  ), an indication that these brain regions might have a
      reduced ability to interact effectively. Studies in healthy participants have
      shown that this cerebral circuit is necessary for implementing the control of
      emotionally relevant actions ( ). Namely, aPFC downregulates neural processing
      in the amygdala during emotional control ( ), while high levels of endogenous
      testosterone reduce such control-related connectivity between aPFC and amygdala
      ( ). Those findings raise the possibility that aPFC\u2013amygdala connectivity
      is altered when psychopathic offenders need to control emotionally relevant
      actions, with high levels of endogenous testosterone exacerbating that altered
      connectivity. \\n\\nThis study tests these hypotheses by measuring brain activity
      with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 15 psychopathic criminals
      and 19 matched healthy control subjects dealing with a challenge to control
      their emotional behavior. The psychopathy sample was obtained by focused and
      comprehensive screening excluding confounds that are frequently associated with
      random criminal sampling (e.g., medication use, comorbidity). The social approach\u2013avoidance
      (AA) task was used to provide reliable indexes of control over social emotional
      behavior ( ;  ;  , ). Behaviorally, psychopathic participants previously showed
      altered AA behavior to explicitly approaching and avoiding emotional faces (
      ). Similar findings occurred after testosterone administration in healthy participants
      ( ). Interestingly, a more subtle version of the AA task has been shown to be
      sensitive to testosterone-related alterations and genetic variations in the
      aPFC\u2013amygdala pathway, while keeping behavior constant across experimental
      groups ( ), opening the way for isolating neural vulnerability factors ( ) in
      psychopathy. During this task, participants respond to affective faces (happy,
      angry) presented for a short time with approach and avoidance movements. Automatic
      emotional tendencies (approach\u2013happy and avoid\u2013angry faces; affect-congruent
      response conditions) need to be controlled during affect-incongruent response
      conditions in order to apply the counterintuitive action of approaching angry
      and avoiding happy faces ( ;  ). Healthy participants respond more slowly and
      rely more strongly on the aPFC when emotional control is required, operationalized
      by the differences evoked between affect-incongruent and affect-congruent trials
      ( ;  ). Accordingly, this study tests whether exerting control over emotionally
      relevant actions is reflected by reduced functionality of the aPFC\u2013amygdala
      circuit in psychopathic individuals, suggesting less prefrontal regulation of
      emotional actions. In addition, it sets out to test whether this alteration
      is intensified by high levels of endogenous testosterone. \\n  \\nThe emotional
      control AA task. The AA task involved the presentation of happy and angry faces,
      and the performance of approach and avoidance responses. During the AA task,
      the participants had to select their response according to the perceived emotion
      of the face. At the beginning of each block of 12 trials, the participants received
      instructions on whether to pull the joystick toward themselves (approach) or
      push it away (avoid) when seeing a face with a particular emotion. When viewing
      happy or angry faces, automatic stimulus\u2013response tendencies trigger corresponding
      approach or avoidance actions. These tendencies could be followed during the
      affect-congruent condition (approach\u2013happy, avoid\u2013angry). In contrast,
      when task instructions required participants to avoid happy faces or to approach
      angry faces, automatic tendencies needed to be controlled and overridden with
      the instructed response (affect-incongruent condition). Participants saw the
      faces and moved the joystick while lying in a MR scanner (top left corner of
      the table). Figure adapted from  ). \\n  \\n\\n## Materials and Methods \\n
      \ \\n### Participants \\n  \\nThe psychopathic group was recruited from in-patient
      populations of the Pompestichting and Oldenkotte, forensic psychiatric institutes
      (TBS-clinics) in the Netherlands. TBS-clinics are facilities for criminal offenders
      with a mental disorder treated on behalf of the state. \\n\\nSeventeen male
      psychopathic violent offenders (age range, 23-56 years) participated; all had
      received a diagnosis with a PCL-R score of \u226526, according to European standards
      ( ;  ;  ). PCL-R consensus scores were obtained by trained clinicians based
      on a structured PCL-R interview, clinical status, and history. After the independent
      scoring, the two raters compared their scores and came to the consensus score.
      When no consensus could be found, a third independent rater was included in
      the process. Dutch versions of the National Adult Reading Test and Edinburgh
      Handedness Inventory were used to assess IQ levels and right-handedness ( ;
      \ ). Twenty-one healthy male control subjects (HCs) matched for age, right-handedness,
      and IQ, without criminal records or history of psychiatric disorders, were recruited
      from staff of the clinics. All participants received oral and written information
      about the experiment and gave written informed consent according to guidelines
      of the local ethics committee (Commissie Mensengebonden Onderzoek region Arnhem-Nijmegen).
      Psychiatric exclusion criteria consisted of neurological, axis-I, and axis-II
      disorders, besides antisocial personality disorder for the psychopathic group.
      They were screened for these exclusion criteria by trained psychologists using
      Dutch versions of the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID;  ) and Mini-International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI;  ) for   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      of Mental Disorders  , 4th edition, disorders. All participants were asked about
      drug use and medical/neurological history to exclude the following: alcohol
      use of >3 units/day, cannabis, or other illicit drug use 1 week before, psychotropic
      medication other than oxazepam 5 d before, 1 unit of alcohol or oxazepam use
      within 24 h before the experiment; history of trauma capitis; visual and auditive
      disorder; and neurological disorder. Furthermore, general exclusion criteria
      for MRI experiments were applied. Two psychopathic patients (PPs) and two HCs
      were excluded from the analyses, due to incomplete scanning procedures (1 PP,
      1 HC) or too many errors on the task (>16%, representing the outlier with a
      \  z  -score >3). The final groups did not differ in age, IQ, and handedness
      (see  ). \\n  \\nDemographical data \\n    \\n\\n### Procedure \\n  \\nTwo test
      sessions took place. During the first session, right-handedness, IQ, MINI, and
      SCID were assessed. During the second session, participants completed several
      questionnaires upon arrival in the laboratory, including the State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory (STAI) to measure anxiety levels ( ). Next, they provided saliva for
      the testosterone measurement. Afterward, participants were positioned in the
      1.5 T MR scanner and familiarized with the task setup. Immediately after this,
      the fMRI session started with the AA task (duration, 30 min) followed by another
      task (not included in this report). After a short break outside the scanner,
      the anatomical scan (duration, 5 min) and an unrelated task were acquired in
      the side-by-side 3 T MR scanner. \\n\\n\\n### Experimental task \\n  \\nThe
      AA task consisted of 24 blocks (with 12 trials per block and a baseline period
      of 21-24 s) during which participants had to respond to visually presented faces
      either by pulling a joystick toward themselves (approach) or by pushing it away
      from themselves (avoid;  ). The participants had to categorize faces as happy,
      angry, and neutral (filler items), based on their affective expressions. During
      each block, two of the three affective expressions were presented as stimuli,
      because only two responses could be given to categorize the stimulus. This resulted
      in six different block types each used four times, representing the affect (happy\u2013angry,
      happy\u2013neutral, angry\u2013neutral) \xD7 movement (approach\u2013avoid)
      combinations. At the start of each block, participants received written instructions
      regarding the required response mapping. The affect \xD7 movement combinations
      were pseudorandomly and evenly distributed (with no affect combination repetition),
      and the combination of the first block was counterbalanced across participants.
      Within each block, affective expressions and gender types were pseudorandomly
      presented, avoiding three or more sequential presentations of the same expression/gender,
      and two presentations of the same facial model. Each face was presented for
      100 ms, preceded by a 300 ms blank screen, and followed by the participant\u2019s
      response, a blank screen, and by a pseudorandom intertrial interval (ITI; 1-3
      s). A baseline period of 21-24 s preceded each block. The faces were from 36
      models (18 male) obtained from several databases ( ;  ;  ; ), each showing all
      expressions. The pictures were in grayscale, matched for brightness and contrast
      values, and displayed against a black background. To exclude influence from
      hair and nonfacial contours, the faces were trimmed. Joystick displacements
      of >80% along the sagittal plane within 2 s from stimulus presentation were
      marked as valid responses. Invalid responses were signaled for 1 s with written
      feedback stating \u201Cyou did not move your joystick far enough.\u201D After
      moving the joystick, participants had to return to the starting position (defined
      as the central area extending 20% along the sagittal plane) before the end of
      the ITI. Otherwise, visual feedback indicated \u201Creturn the joystick to the
      starting position,\u201D and the ITI was repeated after participants returned
      the joystick. The training at the beginning consisted of six blocks; one block
      of eight trials for each of the six affect \xD7 movement combinations. Different
      visual stimuli were used during the training and scanning blocks. \\n\\n\\n###
      Materials and apparatus \\n  \\nThe fMR images were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI
      scanner (Avanto, Siemens Medical Systems) with an eight-channel head coil using
      a multiecho generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA)
      sequence [ ; repetition time (TR), 2.14 ms; five echo times (TEs), 9.4/21/33/44/56
      ms; 34 transversal slices; ascending acquisition; distance factor, 17%; effective
      voxel size, 3.3 \xD7 3.3 \xD7 3.5 mm; field of view (FOV), 212 mm]. High-resolution
      anatomical images were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner with a 32-channel head
      coil using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (TR, 2300 ms;
      TE, 3.03 ms; 192 sagittal slices; voxel size, 1.0 \xD7 1.0 \xD7 1.0 mm; FOV,
      256 mm). \\n\\nAn MR-compatible joystick (Fiber Optic Joystick, Current Designs;
      sampling rate, 550 Hz) was placed on participants\u2019 abdomens to ensure comfortable
      push-and-pull movements ( ). Participants wore MR-compatible headphones to reduce
      scanner noise (Commander XG MRI Audio System, Resonance Technologies). Stimuli
      were projected at the center of a screen, viewed via a mirror above the participant\u2019s
      head, with a visual angle of 4\xB0 \xD7 6\xB0 (width \xD7 height). Stimuli presentation
      and acquisition of joystick positions were controlled by a PC running Presentation
      version 13 ( ). \\n\\n\\n### Salivary measurements \\n  \\nParticipants filled
      two Salicaps (IBL) with saliva for testosterone measurement, which were stored
      at \u221225\xB0C. Testosterone concentration was measured using competitive
      chemiluminescence immunoassay with a sensitivity of 0.0025 ng/ml (IBL International,
      Tecan). Intra-assay and interassay coefficients are between 10% and 12%. To
      control variables influencing testosterone levels, participants were instructed
      to refrain from any food, cigarettes, and drinks (except water) for 1 h before
      the experiment. \\n\\n\\n### Behavioral analysis \\n  \\nBehavioral data was
      analyzed using MATLAB version 7.9 (MathWorks) and PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc.).
      First, to obtain a precise measure of movement onset [reaction time (RT)], the
      joystick movement for each trial was reconstructed using the joystick displacement
      measurements. Excluded trials showed a joystick movement in the wrong direction,
      an extreme RT (<150 or >1500 ms), peak velocity (<0.1 cm/s), or movement time
      (>400 ms); or an error rate of above chance level in a block (in that case,
      the whole block was excluded). RTs and testosterone levels were log transformed
      to obtain a normal distribution. Second, following previous studies ( ;  ),
      we conducted three-way repeated-measures ANOVA (ANCOVArm) on the mean RT and
      error rates, with factors group (PP, HC), movement (approach, avoid), and valence
      (happy, angry), including standardized testosterone and STAI state as covariate.
      A measure of anxiety (STAI) was included to account for the effects of psychopathy
      type (e.g., primary vs secondary); and the possible effects on emotional behavior,
      hormonal levels, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex functioning ( ;  ;  ; ). The
      \u03B1-level was set at   p   < 0.05. \\n\\n\\n### Functional MRI data \\n  \\n####
      Single-subject analyses \\n  \\nImaging data were preprocessed and analyzed
      using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping;  ). The first four volumes of each
      participant\u2019s dataset were discarded to allow for   T   equilibration.
      Given the multiecho GRAPPA MR sequence (Poser et al., 2006), head motion parameters
      were estimated on MR images with the shortest TE (9.4 ms), since these are least
      affected by possible artifacts. These motion correction parameters, estimated
      using a least-squares approach with six rigid body transformation parameters
      (translations, rotations), were applied to the five echo images collected for
      each excitation. After spatial realignment, the five echo images were combined
      into a single MR volume using an optimized echo weighting method (Poser et al.,
      2006). The time series for each voxel was temporally realigned to the first
      slice in time. The   T  -weighted image was spatially coregistered to the mean
      of the functional images. The fMRI time series were transformed and resampled
      at an isotropic voxel size of 2 mm into standard Montreal Neurological Institute
      (MNI) space by unified segmentation and normalization using the coregistered
      \  T  -weighted image ( ). The normalized functional images were spatially smoothed
      using an isotropic 8 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. \\n\\nThe
      fMRI time series of each subject were further analyzed using an event-related
      approach in the context of general linear model, including the following effects:
      approach\u2013happy, approach\u2013neutral, approach\u2013angry, avoid\u2013happy,
      avoid\u2013neutral, and avoid\u2013angry. Trials excluded from behavioral analyses
      and periods of instructions or feedback were modeled as regressors. Vectors
      describing the time of picture presentation (onset) and RT of each event (duration)
      were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Potential confounding
      effects of residual head movement were modeled using original, squared, cubic,
      first-order, and second-order derivatives of the movement correction parameters
      ( ). Three further regressors, describing the time course of signal intensities
      of white matter, CSF, and the portion of the MR image outside the skull were
      also added. This procedure accounts for image intensity shifts due to hand movements
      within or near the magnetic field of the scanner ( ). Finally, fMRI time series
      were high-pass filtered (cutoff 120 s). Temporal autocorrelation was modeled
      as a first-order autoregressive process. \\n\\n\\n#### Group analyses \\n  \\nConsistent
      effects across participants and between groups were tested using a random-effects
      multiple regression analysis that included six contrast images (approach\u2013happy,
      approach\u2013neutral, approach\u2013angry, avoid\u2013happy, avoid\u2013neutral,
      avoid\u2013angry) per participant. Together, these images represented the estimated
      cerebral effects from 12 conditions of the experimental design [group (PP, HC)
      \xD7 valence (happy, neutral, angry) \xD7 response (approach, avoid)]. Standardized
      log-transformed testosterone and standardized STAI state levels were included
      in the multiple regression analysis as condition-specific [group (PP, HC) \xD7
      valence (happy, neutral, angry) \xD7 response (approach, avoid)] regressors,
      generating another 12 regressors per variable. \\n\\nAll analyses assessed the
      congruency effect, reflecting task-related differences of affect-incongruent
      (approach\u2013angry, avoid\u2013happy) versus affect-congruent trials (approach\u2013happy,
      avoid\u2013angry;  ;  ). We considered two effects. First, to test for general
      effects of congruency, we performed an analysis on the congruency effect over
      both groups and for each group separately. When assessing the effects of one
      group explicitly, we also tested whether those effects were specific to that
      group and were significantly weaker in the other group (at   p   < 0.05 uncorrected)
      by masking the statistical map describing the congruency effect in the first
      group (using multiple comparisons correction, see below) with the statistical
      map describing the group \xD7 congruency contrast. Second, to test whether testosterone
      differentially modulated the control of emotionally relevant actions in the
      groups, we performed a group \xD7 congruency contrast on the regressor parametrizing
      interindividual differences in testosterone on task-related conditions. If such
      an interaction is present, the testosterone modulation on the congruency effect
      of each group separately is considered. In addition to whole-brain analyses,
      we used a volume of interest (VOI) on coordinates previously found to be modulated
      by testosterone during the congruency effect in healthy students (two 8-mm-radius
      spheres centered on the following MNI coordinates:   x  , \u221230;   y  , 58;
      and z, 2; and   x  , 32;   y  , 54; and   z  , 8;  ). \\n\\nThe reported activations
      are corrected for multiple comparisons using familywise error (FWE) correction.
      For whole-brain analyses, we made inferences at cluster level (FWE:   p   <
      0.05, corresponding to a cluster size of >140 on the basis of intensity threshold,
      \  p   < 0.001). For VOI analyses, we made inferences at voxel-level (FWE corrected,
      \  p   < 0.05;  ;  ). Anatomical inference is drawn by superimposing SPM showing
      significant signal changes on structural images of participants. For anatomical
      accuracy, we report only activation peaks in gray matter. Anatomical landmarks
      were identified using the atlas of  . Brodmann areas (BAs) were assigned by
      superimposing significant SPM on the SPM anatomy toolbox ( ) and MRIcron template
      ( /). \\n\\n\\n\\n### Connectivity analyses \\n  \\nThe aim of the following
      analysis was to test whether inter-regional coupling of the aPFC (see Results)
      with the amygdala and other brain regions during the congruency effect was different
      between the groups and modulated by testosterone. To test for these effects,
      we used the psychophysiological interactions (PPIs) method ( ). More specifically,
      we tested for significant differences between the regression coefficients of
      each voxel over the right aPFC during the affect-incongruent versus the affect-congruent
      conditions. To select voxels to be included in the VOI, we used the following
      anatomical constraints ( ): for each participant, selected voxels fell within
      a sphere with a radius of 4 mm around the peak voxel corresponding to the activated
      cluster of the congruency effect over both groups (coordinates:   x  , 30;   y
      \ , 58;   z  , 14; see Results). Participant specific contrast images were generated
      describing the PPI between the time courses of the right aPFC VOI and affect-incongruent
      versus affect-congruent conditions. Group differences and testosterone modulations
      on task-related coupling between the aPFC and other regions were then assessed
      using a multiple regression design on participant-specific contrast images with
      their corresponding testosterone (log-transformed, standardized) and STAI state
      (standardized) levels as subject- and group-specific regressors. In addition
      to whole-brain analyses, we assessed significant voxel-level effects (FWE corrected
      for multiple comparisons,   p   < 0.05) within the amygdala, defined on the
      Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas ( ) using the WFU PickAtlas tool ( ). \\n\\n\\n\\n##
      Results \\n  \\n### Behavioral results \\n  \\nFifteen psychopathic criminals
      (PPs; PCL-R score of \u226526, according to European standards ( ;  ;  ) and
      19 HCs (for demographics, see  ) were included in the analyses. Participants
      performed the task accurately and consistently (error rates: PPs, 7.9%; HCs,
      7.3%; omissions: PPs, 1.6%; HCs, 1.5%; undefined responses: PPs, 0.9%; HCs,
      0.3%;  ). \\n  \\nRTs and error rates for each group and factor of the AA task
      \\n    \\nA significant movement \xD7 valence interaction for the RTs indicated
      that, over groups, participants responded more slowly during affect-incongruent
      (approach\u2013angry, avoid\u2013happy) than during affect-congruent trials
      (approach\u2013happy, avoid\u2013angry;   F   = 10.4,   p   = 0.003;  ). This
      congruency effect replicates the behavioral results from previous fMRI studies
      ( ;  ). Furthermore, there were main effects of movement (  F   = 26.3,   p
      \  < 0.001) and valence (  F   = 28.7,   p   < 0.001), reflecting the slowing
      of avoidance movements and responses to angry faces in general ( ). There were
      no significant effects involving group, including no main effect (  p   > 0.3).
      The congruency effect correlated positively (without corrections for multiple
      comparisons) with the PCL-R total score (  p   = 0.048,   R   = 0.517, respectively).
      Excluding anxiety from the analyses did not affect the outcomes. Moreover, when
      including the neutral conditions in the analyses, the movement \xD7 valence
      (happy, neutral, angry) interaction for RTs remained significant (  F   = 5.5,
      \  p   = 0.010), showing that neutral approach\u2013avoidance effects are intermediary
      compared with happy and angry ( ). \\n  \\nBehavioral results. Mean RTs (\xB1SEM)
      for the affect-congruent and affect-incongruent conditions of the AA task for
      the healthy control subjects and psychopathic offenders. The groups were significantly
      slower to provide affect-incongruent responses (approach\u2013angry; avoid\u2013happy)
      than affect-congruent responses (approach\u2013happy; avoid\u2013angry), with
      no significant group differences. \\n  \\nFor the error rates, the three-way

      did not differ between groups (  p   > 0.4), and showed no correlations with
      psychopathy (PCL-R) scores or with each other (  p   > 0.1). \\n\\n\\n### fMRI
      results \\n  \\n#### Multiple regression analyses \\n  \\nTo assess the two
      main questions of this study, we isolated cerebral structures showing stronger
      responses during affect-incongruent than affect-congruent trials (congruency
      effect), and cerebral structures in which the congruency effect was modulated
      by testosterone levels. \\n\\nThe results showed a significant congruency effect
      across groups in the aPFC [ROI analysis: MNI coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z
      \ ): (30, 58, 14) and (\u221230 58 10);   p   = 0.001 and 0.036;   t   = 4.46
      and 3.43; for further details, see  ]. As expected, this effect was driven by
      the healthy control group, and it was significantly weaker in the psychopathic
      offenders [  p   = 0.001 and 0.040;   t   = 4.58 and 3.40, on the congruency
      effect in healthy control subjects masked implicitly by group (HC > PP) \xD7
      congruency interaction]. The implicit masking demonstrates that the group \xD7
      congruency interaction is also significant at   p   < 0.05 within the significant
      voxels corrected for multiple comparisons on the HC congruency effect. The psychopathy
      group showed no significant congruency effect in this region (  p   > 0.3).
      There was also a significant congruency effect across groups in the right superior
      parietal lobule (whole-brain analysis); this effect was driven mainly by the
      psychopathy group ( ). \\n  \\nClusters showing significantly larger activity
      for the affect-incongruent vs the affect-congruent conditions (emotion-control
      effect) \\n    \\nCritically, testosterone modulated the congruency effect in
      the aPFC differently in psychopathic offenders and healthy control subjects
      (whole-brain analysis on testosterone \xD7 group \xD7 congruency: MINI coordinates
      (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ): (30, 58, 12);   p   < 0.001;   t   = 5.10; for all details,
      see  ).   Post hoc   analyses revealed that, in the psychopathy group, congruency
      effects decreased as testosterone levels increased [MNI coordinates (  x  ,
      \  y  ,   z  ): (32, 56, 10) and (\u221230, 58, 8);   p   = 0.002 and 0.015;
      \  t   = 4.34 and 3.74]. The modulatory effect of testosterone on congruency
      was absent in the healthy control subjects (  p   \u2265 0.05;  ). The whole-brain
      analysis also showed an effect in the right caudate nucleus and right inferior
      supramarginal gyrus, driven by reduced congruency effects as a function of testosterone
      in the psychopathy group ( ;  ). \\n  \\nTestosterone modulations of the cerebral

      activity for the congruency effect and no modulation by testosterone, while
      in psychopathic offenders endogenous testosterone levels modulate the activity
      of the aPFC and right supramarginal gyrus. \\n  \\n\\n#### Effective connectivity
      analyses \\n  \\nGiven the relevance of aPFC\u2013amygdala connectivity for
      implementing emotional control as evoked by the AA task ( ), we assessed whether
      psychopathy also resulted in altered connectivity along that neural pathway.
      Connectivity analyses using the right aPFC [4-mm-radius sphere; central voxel
      from main analysis (MNI coordinates:   x  , 30;   y  , 58;   z  , 14)] as the
      seed region on the congruency effect indicated a significant group difference
      (PP > HC) with the right amygdala ( ; ROI analysis; extent, 3 voxels;   t   =

      \ , \u221216). When testing effects for both groups separately, healthy control
      subjects showed a significant negative coupling between the right aPFC and amygdala
      (ROI analysis; extent: 3 voxels,   t   = 3.70;   p   = 0.036; MNI coordinates
      of local maxima:   x  , 32;   y  , 0;   z  , \u221216), while psychopathic offenders
      showed no differential connectivity effect.   Post hoc   testing on right amygdala
      voxels showing the group interaction (threshold,   p   < 0.05 FWE) indicated
      a significant positive correlation with testosterone over both groups (ROI analysis;

      \  x  , 32;   y  , 2;   z  , \u221216). There was no correlation between aPFC\u2013amygdala
      connectivity and the PCL-R scores (  p   > 0.2). \\n  \\nGroup difference on

      coupling in the healthy control subjects, which is not present in the psychopathic
      offenders. \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n## Discussion \\n  \\nThis study indicates that
      psychopathic offenders show reduced aPFC activity as well as less aPFC\u2013amygdala
      connectivity during the control of emotional behavior. Emotional control was
      measured by comparing affect-incongruent and affect-congruent approach\u2013avoidance
      responses to emotional faces (congruency effect on the AA task;  ). When healthy
      control subjects exerted emotional control, reaction times, aPFC activity, and
      aPFC\u2013amygdala anticorrelations increased, confirming previous observations
      ( ). In contrast, psychopathic offenders did not show this typical control-related
      pattern of aPFC activity and connectivity. In addition, these effects were significantly
      modulated by endogenous testosterone. Namely, psychopathic individuals with
      relatively lower testosterone levels showed a neural activity and connectivity
      pattern that resembled the findings in healthy control subjects, while this
      pattern was absent in those with higher testosterone levels. This indicates
      that especially psychopathic individuals with high testosterone levels have
      less prefrontal regulation of amygdala-driven emotional actions when the control
      of emotional behavior is required. \\n\\n### Emotional control in psychopathy
      \\n  \\nImaging studies have illustrated an association between psychopathy
      and altered processing of fear, including altered amygdala responses ( ;  ;
      \ ), attentional deficits for peripheral stimuli ( ), and moral/empathic insensitivity
      ( ;  ). However, psychopathic offenders also show clear impulsivity problems
      ( ), for example, when control is required during emotionally provoking situations.
      To address this relatively unexplored but crucial component of criminal psychopathy,
      we used a paradigm requiring rule-driven control of emotional actions. With
      this paradigm, it was possible to move beyond simple motor inhibition and to
      target the flexible control of emotionally driven action tendencies. \\n\\nFirst,
      the aPFC (also called BA 10) was less active in psychopathic offenders as a
      function of testosterone. The aPFC is a region crucial for the control of social
      emotional behavior. When aPFC functioning is temporarily disrupted, participants
      have increased difficulty in overriding emotional tendencies with rule-driven
      behavior ( ). Moreover, the aPFC seems especially important for integrating
      and coordinating multiple cognitive processes to facilitate response selection
      ( ;  ). For example, transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced reduction of
      aPFC functioning during the control of emotional behavior decreased activity
      in brain areas associated with rule selection (posterior parietal cortex), while
      both amygdala activity and automatic action tendencies increased ( ). The current
      study indicates that psychopathic individuals with especially high testosterone
      levels recruited the aPFC less when the control of emotional responses was needed.
      This finding suggests that they have reduced coordination of rule-based behavior
      with emotional information. \\n\\nSecond, connectivity between the aPFC and
      amygdala also differed significantly between groups. Healthy control subjects
      showed a negative aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling during the control of social emotional
      behavior, whereas psychopathic individuals showed no significant coupling between
      these regions. Evidence of anatomical connectivity alterations between these
      regions in psychopathic individuals and the relation of that tract to social
      emotional behavior modifications support these findings ( ). Although these
      results cannot resolve the direction of these connectivity effects, a previous
      study ( ) using this paradigm showed an effective connectivity modulation of
      emotional control on the connection from aPFC to amygdala. Also, animal studies
      ( ) suggest strong prefrontal inhibitory connections that control automatic
      amygdala responses. The absence of this aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling in psychopathic
      offenders suggests that in this group the aPFC has a reduced ability to inhibit
      amygdala-driven responses. This study used subtle emotional provocations, but
      stronger emotional events result in stronger amygdala responses, increasing
      the bias for automatic emotional behavior ( ). A lack of prefrontal control
      likely reduces the ability to inhibit these biases and lead to an increased
      expression of automatic emotional actions even when they are not beneficial
      ( ;  ). \\n\\nTestosterone administration studies also illustrated a decoupling
      between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, suggesting that testosterone
      reduces the communication between the PFC and amygdala ( ;  ;  ) and, within
      the AA task, reduces top-down control. The association between testosterone
      levels and enhanced social aggression and dominance seeking, and reduced impulse
      control in the general population ( ;  ;  ) supports the relevance of testosterone
      in this process. Even amygdala responses to angry faces have recently been found
      to be enhanced after testosterone administration and in psychopathic individuals
      ( ;  ;  ). There is a clear association between testosterone and aggression
      after provocation, which has been related to reduced activity in the orbital
      frontal cortex, a region just ventral of the aPFC ( ). Interestingly, psychopathic
      offenders with lower testosterone levels displayed a pattern similar to that
      in healthy control subjects, while the psychopathic individuals with high testosterone
      levels showed less aPFC activity and aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling. This could
      provide a potential vulnerability factor explaining the difference between the
      goal-directed \u201Csuccessful\u201D psychopath and the \u201Cunsuccessful\u201D
      psychopath with reduced impulse control ( ;  ). We hypothesize that especially
      psychopathic individuals with high testosterone levels fail to inhibit amygdala-driven
      action tendencies using the aPFC during the control of emotional behavior.\\n
      \\n\\nEndogenous testosterone levels also modulated control-related activity
      in the supramarginal gyrus and caudate nucleus of the psychopathy group. The
      supramarginal gyrus was previously found to be involved during emotional control
      on the AA task in a healthy student sample ( ). Previous work indicated that
      it plays an important role in action organization ( ), and that psychopathic
      individuals show reduced supramarginal gyrus activity compared with control
      subjects when reasoning about other people\u2019s emotional state ( ). The current
      findings, emphasizing the role of supramarginal gyrus during emotional control
      in psychopathic offenders with low testosterone levels, could indicate the facilitation
      of action preparation in trials with affect-incongruent stimulus\u2013response
      mapping. The caudate nucleus is important for incorporating predicted action
      outcome, when selecting the most beneficial behavioral goal ( ), and has previously
      found to be larger in psychopathy ( ). In light of these findings, our results
      suggest that psychopathic offenders with low endogenous testosterone levels,
      as opposed to those with high testosterone levels, have more interference of
      automatic action tendencies and outcomes associated with the facial emotions
      (e.g., approach\u2013happy) that are opposite to the required actions during
      affect-incongruent trials ( ). \\n\\n\\n### Interpretational issues \\n  \\nIndividuals
      with psychopathy have been suggested to have difficulty recognizing emotional
      expressions. However, this impairment seems quite specific to fear, rather than
      the emotional expressions used here (anger and happiness;  ;  ). Furthermore,
      the groups assessed in this study made comparable numbers of errors, suggesting
      that psychopathic offenders had no special difficulty in recognizing the clear
      emotional expressions used in this study. \\n\\nThis study used a relatively
      subtle manipulation to target the emotional control system. The rationale of
      this choice was to detect neural vulnerability markers without affecting behavioral
      performance. Psychopathic offenders performing a more salient behavioral version
      of the AA task showed reduced avoidance of angry faces ( ). In this study, angry
      faces evoked numerically similar behavioral effects ( ) and, additionally, aPFC
      effects (  post hoc   inspection of extracted parameters). Although these observations
      could be interpreted as a sign that psychopathic offenders have a tendency to
      approach angry faces, those observations were not statistically significant
      between groups [behavioral and aPFC group effects on angry faces:   p   > 0.2;
      \  p   = 0.271;   z   = 2.54, on the angry\u2013congruency effect in healthy
      control subjects masked implicitly by group (HC > PP) \xD7 angry\u2013congruency
      interaction]. Future investigation is needed to directly test whether more provocative
      paradigms induce specific effects for angry faces. A previous study ( ) using
      this fMRI task in participants with genetic susceptibility for developing aggressive
      disorders, also found no group-specific behavioral effects. That study suggested
      that alterations of the aPFC\u2013amygdala pathway might reflect a vulnerability
      factor for psychopathologies. \\n\\nPreviously, endogenous testosterone modulated
      the aPFC and aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling in a sample of healthy students ( ).
      In that study, a different demographic group of healthy control subjects similarly
      showed a testosterone modulation of aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling, but no testosterone
      modulation of aPFC activity. This difference in the strength of testosterone-modulatory
      effects might be related to between-group differences in age (mean healthy control
      subjects, 41; mean students, 22;  ), educational level (staff of forensic psychiatric
      institute vs university students), or general anxiety [STAI trait, lower in
      healthy control subjects of the current study; mean (SD): 29 (4.4) and 34 (6.9),
      respectively;   t   = \u22122.605;   p   = 0.014]. A limitation of this study
      is the modest sample size. Our focus to exclude moderating factors of comorbid
      disorders (except antisocial personality disorder) and recent drug use has the
      advantage that the sample is relatively homogeneous, but future studies using
      larger samples are needed for replication and to define subsamples. \\n\\n\\n###
      Conclusion \\n  \\nPsychopathic offenders showed reduced aPFC activity and aPFC\u2013amygdala
      connectivity during control of emotional actions, suggesting a decreased coordination
      of emotional information during rule-driven behavior. Moreover, endogenous testosterone
      modulated the involvement of these neural mechanisms. Psychopathic offenders
      with high testosterone levels showed less involvement of the aPFC, aPFC\u2013amygdala
      connectivity, supramarginal gyrus, and caudate nucleus, whereas psychopathic
      individuals with low testosterone levels recruited the aPFC in a fashion similar
      to that of healthy control subjects. These findings suggest that a lack of prefrontal
      control during emotional actions may explain enhanced impulsivity in psychopathic
      offenders during emotionally provoking situations. They outline a neuroendocrine
      model underlying impulsive emotional behavior in psychopathy and support the
      relevance of assessing a potential imbalance in testosterone function to guide
      treatment. It remains to be seen whether these neuroendocrine alterations of
      emotional control are also present in highly impulsive or antisocial individuals.

      sample:  \\n## Introduction \\n  \\nWith more than 25% of high school seniors
      reporting recent use and 6.5% of 12th graders being daily users ( ), marijuana
      (MJ) is the most frequently used illicit substance among adolescents. Across
      all age groups over 70% of new drug initiates start with using MJ at an average
      age of 18 years ( ). Indeed, the scope of MJ use prevalence is of great public
      interest, as MJ use in early adolescence is associated with increased risk of
      greater substance use, legal problems, disrupting education, injuries/medical
      problems, developing psychopathology, cognitive changes and chronic psychosocial
      struggles ( ,  ,  ,  ). Taken together, rates of MJ use are suggestive of an
      epidemic based in adolescence, which is concerning not just due to societal
      cost, but also due to the potential to offset sensitive brain development during
      this period. \\n\\nDespite its prevalence, the impact of MJ use on adolescent
      brain development is not fully known. Important neuromaturational processes
      during adolescence through young adulthood are believed to bring about improved
      higher-order cognition by refining neural systems locally and globally through
      white and gray matter development ( ,  ,  ). In general, gray matter reductions
      and cortical thinning coincide with increased white matter volume and organization
      through adolescence and young adulthood, suggestive of synaptic pruning and
      axonal myelination ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The endogenous cannabinoid (CB) system is
      also immature during adolescence ( ,  ). In an animal model ( ) imaged CB1 receptor
      binding using PET and found relatively lower activation of CB1 receptors in
      adolescent rats compared to adult rats in brain areas including those in the
      frontal cortex, temporal lobe (hippocampus and amygdala) and sub-cortical regions
      including striatal regions, thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus. Thus,
      adolescence represents a developmental period with vulnerability to structural
      and functional changes due to exogenous MJ exposure. \\n\\nAdolescent MJ use
      has the potential to cause structural and functional changes in the brain by
      altering cannabinoid signaling. One possible mechanism would be blunt neurotoxic
      influence. For example, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive
      component in MJ that binds CB1 receptors, is reported to cause cell shrinkage
      and damage DNA strands in THC-treated neuron cultures ( ). This may be the mechanism
      by which smaller volumes have been observed in individuals exposed to cannabis
      during adolescence ( ). However, it is more likely that MJ exerts its influence
      on brain development indirectly. The cannabinoid system plays a role in modulating
      other neurotransmitters, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate
      and monoamines ( ). Specifically, activation of CB1 receptors is associated
      with down-regulating inhibitory GABAergic transmission in cortical interneurons
      during adolescence ( ,  ). In addition, CB signaling inhibits microglia function
      ( ). These two points are important because cortical pruning processes involve
      glial-mediated synaptic elimination and altering the excitatory/inhibitory balance
      is liable to disrupt the selective tagging and preserving synapses ( ). The
      impact of this indirect influence on the developing brain may be in the observations
      of abnormal connectivity in those who began MJ use in adolescence ( ). Evidence
      from human neuroimaging studies lends greater support to MJ-related disruptions
      to brain development. \\n\\nStructural neuroimaging studies have indicated that
      volumes of several brain areas are smaller in heavy adult MJ users especially
      in areas enriched with cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors, such as medial temporal
      lobe, and prefrontal cortex ( ). Studies of adult chronic MJ users note brain
      volume reductions in temporal lobe, insula, and prefrontal cortex, amygdala
      and hippocampus ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Among different characteristics of MJ involvement
      (e.g., dependence symptoms, use frequency, consumption), the age of initial
      MJ use is a robust factor that has been associated with smaller brain volumes
      in users. For example,   observed left parahippocampal gyrus and right temporal
      pole structural differences in 25 regular MJ users compared to 22 occasional
      users, however, even the occasional users who began smoking MJ during adolescence
      (before age 18) demonstrated similar brain changes as the regular users. Our
      group has also found links with early MJ use onset ( ) and structural connectivity
      with orbitofrontal cortex in a cohort of daily MJ users, suggesting complex
      neuroadaptive processes related to MJ use in the context of adolescent brain
      development ( ). These findings underscore the potential for significant heterogeneity
      in brain changes among adult MJ users, especially those who began using MJ during
      neurodevelopment. \\n\\nStudies comparing early adolescent MJ use to users initiating
      MJ use in later adolescence provide further evidence for the potential of MJ
      to cause enduring change. The few studies that have directly investigated the
      timing of the effects of MJ during adolescence have noted divergent neurodevelopment
      effects. For example, in an fMRI study by Gruber and colleagues, functional
      and behavioral differences during an interference task were reported between
      early (before age 16) and late (after age 16) MJ users ( ) ( ). The same group
      also reported decreased white matter integrity in early onset vs. late onset
      MJ users (mean age 14.46 vs. 17.93) ( ). Similar differential effects have also
      been noted in parietal lobe activation between early and late adolescent binge
      drinkers during a spatial working memory task ( ). These studies highlight the
      importance of clarifying the differential neural effects of early- and late-adolescent
      onset use. \\n\\nTo that end, in the current study, we compared daily MJ users
      who were early onset users (<16 years old) versus late onset users (\u226516
      years old) on measures of cortical morphology that are sensitive to developmental
      changes. We aimed to characterize both the effect of early onset status on cortical
      morphology as well as assess for morphological patterns linked to the continued
      use of MJ after early and late adolescent MJ initiation. We expected early onset
      users to show a morphological pattern consistent with disruption of early adolescent
      brain development (e.g., increased cortical thickness, greater gray/white definition
      of the cortical ribbon via disruptions to adolescent pruning processes) that
      may be more consistent with indirect impact of MJ of brain development. While
      gray matter decline has been shown to be associated with marijuana use, particularly
      in areas rich in CB1 receptors, increased cortical thickness and greater gray/white
      definition in the cortical ribbon point to potential disruption in neurodevelopment
      (i.e. synaptic pruning) that may result from MJ use at key developmental stages
      (i.e. earlier as opposed to later in adolescent neuronal development). Such
      disruptions may extend to gyrification as well. While this process begins in
      utero, there is evidence that gyrification is ongoing into adolescence ( ,  ,
      \ ) and may also display aberrant developmental patterns in the presence of
      MJ use. \\n\\n\\n## Methods \\n  \\nThis study was approved by the University
      of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
      (UTSW) Institutional Review Boards. All participants were recruited from the
      Dallas-Ft.Worth metro area via flyers and advertisements. Following informed
      consent, MJ users completed two sessions \u2013 a baseline appointment for collecting
      demographic, psychosocial and behavioral measures and a thorough substance use
      history. Three days later the participants returned for a neuroimaging appointment.
      Prior to their scanning session, participants were asked to be abstinent from
      MJ use for 72\_h, from alcohol for 24\_h, and from caffeine and cigarettes for
      the preceding 2\_h. These were confirmed by self-report (MJ, alcohol, caffeine
      and cigarettes), quantitative THC urinalysis (MJ), and by breath alcohol level
      of .000 (alcohol) at the start of their session. \\n\\n### Participants \\n
      \ \\nWe scanned 45 regular heavy MJ users as part of the parent project. Inclusion
      criteria were: right-handedness, English as the primary language and no histories
      of psychosis, traumatic brain injury, and MRI contraindications (e.g., pregnancy,
      non-removal metallic implants, claustrophobia). One subject reported a history
      of anxiety and depression and one other reported a history of ADHD as a child.
      Additional exclusions for the current study included: Axis I diagnosis (via
      SCID) other than cannabis use disorder, unusable sMRI due to motion artifact
      or poor signal-to-noise ratio that precluded accurate tissue segmentation (
      \ n  \_=\_1) and incomplete drug use histories (  n  \_=\_2). Of the 42 remaining
      cases, 22 were early onset users (onset of first use before age 16). Group categorization
      using onset of regular use as opposed to onset of first use maintained the same
      grouping (mean early onset of regular use\_=\_16.5, mean late onset of regular
      use\_=\_19.0). Regular use was defined as at least one time per week. To determine
      how age of onset of regular MJ use influenced our reported effects, we performed
      these analyses while covarying for age of onset of regular use (see  ).   summarizes
      demographic and substance use information according to onset status.   summarizes
      the correlation between age and identified marijuana use variables. Only MJ
      years of use and current age showed a statistically significant correlation.
      Participants were recruited based on self-reported daily MJ use and a positive
      urinalysis for THC metabolites at their baseline visit. All of the participants
      were screened via urinalysis for other drugs of abuse and were excluded if drugs
      (other than MJ) were detected. Participants were required to have used MJ for
      a minimum of 5000 lifetime occasions and self-report daily use (without >24\_h
      abstinence) for the last 60 days.   \\nSample characteristics. MJ, marijuana.

      \\n  \\nScanning sessions took place at the Advanced Imaging Research Center
      at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center three days following
      their initial visit. Another verification of THC metabolites via urinalysis
      was also performed before the scan. MRI images were collected using a 3T Philips
      whole-body scanner equipped with Quasar gradient subsystem (40\_mT/m amplitude,
      a slew rate of 220\_mT/m/ms). High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical scans were
      collected using a MPRAGE sequence: TR/TE/TI\_=\_2100/3.70/1100\_ms; flip angle\_=\_12\xB0;
      field of view\_=\_256\_mm\_\xD7\_256\_mm; slab thickness\_=\_160\_mm (along
      left-right direction); voxel size\_=\_1\_mm\_\xD7\_1\_mm\_\xD7\_1\_mm, Total
      scan time\_=\_3\_m 57\_s. \\n\\n\\n#### Image processing \\n  \\nMPRAGE anatomical
      scans were pre-processed for surface-based analyses using FreeSurfer v5.3 semi-automated
      pipeline ( ). This semi-automated pipeline included spatial (Talairach) and
      signal intensity normalization of images, volumetric segmentation and subcortical
      labeling ( ,  ). Outer gray matter and white matter boundaries were then identified
      and reconstructed into a mesh of over 150,000 tessellated vertices to allow
      point-to-point surface measures ( ). Next, gyral anatomy is aligned to a standard
      spherical template using surface convexity and curvature measures. Resulting
      surfaces were inspected, blind to MJ onset status, to identify and correct any
      errors made during cortical reconstruction. Modifications to the volumes were
      made as necessary to correct for tissue misclassifications according to FreeSurfer's
      wiki manual ( ). In preparation for analysis, each morphological measure for
      each case was co-registered to a standard template (fsaverage). Anatomical labels
      in FreeSurfer ( ) were used for interpretation of results. \\n\\n\\n\\n### Morphological
      measures \\n  \\n#### Cortical thickness \\n  \\nThe width of the cortical ribbon
      was measured as the distance between corresponding vertices of the white matter
      and gray matter surfaces at each vertex in the cortical mantel ( ). \\n\\n\\n####
      Gray\u2013white matter ratio (GWR) \\n  \\nTo assess the quality of cortical
      ribbon definition, a tissue contrast between gray and white matter signal intensities
      was computed as a percent ratio (W\_\u2212\_G)/(.5*(W\_+\_G)) (from pctsurfcon
      v1.11.2.1, inbuilt component of FreeSurfer pipeline v5.3, 2011). White matter
      signal intensities were measured at an absolute length of 1\_mm below the gray\u2013white
      border surface and gray matter signal was measured 30% into the cortical ribbon
      ( ). \\n\\n\\n#### Local gyrification index \\n  \\nThe cortical surface from
      FreeSurfer's main pipeline is further processed to create an outer surface that
      encapsulates the gyral and sulcal curvature for each hemisphere, which serves
      as a basis for calculating a local gyrification index ( ). LGI is measured as
      the amount of cortex within the sulcal folds beneath the outer surface compared
      to the amount of visible cortex that touches the outer surface. Cortical maps
      are generated from repeated iterations of delineating a 25\_mm radius sphere
      on the outer surface and its corresponding point on the cortical surface using
      a matching algorithm. \\n\\n\\n\\n### Background and premorbid characteristics
      \\n  \\n#### Sample characteristics \\n  \\nAge, gender, education level, ethnicity,
      along with other background information, was obtained using a standard demographics
      questionnaire. The two-subtest administration of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale
      of Intelligence (Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning) provided estimates of intellect
      ( ). \\n\\n\\n#### Substance use \\n  \\nThe Substance Use Disorder modules
      of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) ( ) were administered
      by a trained research assistant to assess for lifetime and current symptoms
      of abuse and dependence for alcohol, nicotine, MJ and other substances. The
      SCID interview also provided the onset of use information. A Time Line Follow-Back
      (TLFB) approach was used to quantify alcohol, nicotine, and MJ use patterns
      for 90 days prior to study participation ( ). Marijuana use in grams was obtained
      via self-report in response to probes aimed at quantifying their regular use.
      \\n\\n\\n\\n### Statistical analyses \\n  \\nStatistical analyses were conducted
      in SPSS 18.0 for behavioral and psychosocial measures whereas general linear
      model group comparisons on surfaced-based morphology measures were carried out
      FreeSurfer's built-in application QDEC (v1.5). Independent samples   t  -tests,
      Mann\u2013Whitney   U  -tests or chi-square tests, compared groups on background
      and demographic variables (see  ). Before statistical analysis was conducted,
      the dependent measures of cortical thickness, GWR and LGI were smoothed using
      a FWHM Gaussian filter with a width of either 10 or 15\_mm. Separate univariate
      general linear model (GLM) was then used to model cortical thickness, GWR and
      LGI with onset status of MJ use as a between groups factor. The dependent variables
      were thickness, gray\u2013white ratio or local gyrification index and the independent
      variables were either recent monthly MJ use in grams (MJ grams) or duration
      of MJ use (MJ years). Age and total drinks in the past 2 months were treated
      as nuisance covariates in the model. Using MJ years of use and MJ grams as independent
      predictors of interest allowed us to characterize and differentiate the latent
      developmental effects from cumulative and current effects of MJ use. The variable
      \u201Cmarijuana years of use\u201D was based on the participants\u2019 response
      to the question \u201CFor how many years have you been using marijuana regularly?\u201D
      Of note, an outlier in the early onset group was removed before the statistical
      comparisons were performed. \\n\\n\\n\\n## Results \\n  \\n### Cortical thickness
      \\n  \\nThere were no regions of group differences in cortical thickness by
      early onset status alone, controlled for age and alcohol use. However, MJ use
      characteristics were correlated with anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      thickness based on onset status. Early onset users showed increased thickness
      with increased MJ grams while late onset users showed thinner cortex with increased
      MJ grams (  p  \_<\_0.05 uncorrected) ( ). The same pattern emerged with more
      years of MJ use being associated with thicker region of the right medial temporal
      lobe in the early onset users and the reverse for the late onset users (  p
      \ \_<\_0.05 uncorrected) ( ).   \\nClusters of significant age of onset\_\xD7\_marijuana

      \\n  \\nThere were no regions of group differences in gray\u2013white matter
      contrast by early onset status alone, controlled for age and alcohol use. However,
      current MJ consumption (grams) and onset status were differentially correlated
      with gray\u2013white matter contrast in a left anterior dorsal frontal region
      (  p  \_<\_0.05, FWE corrected). Increased gray\u2013white contrast with heavier
      MJ use was seen in the early onset users and the opposite was seen in later
      onset users (heavier current use linked to decreasing GWR). The same pattern
      was seen between duration of MJ use in two prefrontal cortex clusters of the
      right dorsal frontal and medial orbitofrontal area   p  \_<\_0.05, FWE corrected
      \u2013 more years of MJ use were linked to greater GWR among early users ( ).
      \\n\\n\\n### Gyrification \\n  \\nMJ use onset status alone showed no significant
      main effects above age and alcohol covariates. However, onset status was correlated
      with divergent patterns between local gyrification and MJ use, whereby early
      onset users showed decreasing LGI with increasing MJ consumption and longer
      duration of use in prefrontal cortex regions   p  \_<\_0.05, FWE corrected.
      The left hemisphere clusters encompassed the majority of the length of the middle
      lateral surface of the left cortex, including motor cortices, parietal lobe
      and multimodal integration areas ( ). \\n\\n\\n\\n## Discussion \\n  \\nThe
      present study was designed to characterize the cortical architecture in adolescent
      onset MJ users by comparing early adolescent onset users to late adolescent
      onset in MJ use on measures of cortical thickness, gray/white matter contrast
      and gyrification. The primary finding was that early versus late onset MJ users
      showed a divergent pattern in cortical thickness, definition of the cortical
      ribbon and local gyrification with continued use through and beyond adolescent
      years. Specifically, early onset users showed cortical thickening, enhanced
      gray/white matter contrast, and decreased gyrification in association with more
      years of MJ use and current consumption of MJ in grams in frontal and temporal
      regions \u2013 areas that underlie higher order cognition including executive
      functioning, learning and memory. Findings were above and beyond effects of
      alcohol and current age, therefore, results are less likely to reflect morphological
      trends due to aging. \\n\\nOur findings did not find the expected age of onset
      differences previously reported in marijuana users ( ,  ). This inconsistency
      suggests that the age of onset effects may be more robust in brain white matter
      connectivity ( ) and function ( ) than brain surface morphometry. To date, the
      few studies that have described altered cortical morphology in MJ users have
      led to mixed findings.   identified brain regions with decreased sulcal depth
      suggestive of lower gyrification in a study of adult MJ users.   recently reported
      increased cortical thickness in the entorhinal cortex among 24 adolescent MJ
      users (mean age\_=\_17.7, mean MJ onset age\_=\_15.4) relative to peer controls.
      However, the authors also reported a negative relationship between cortical
      thickness and total MJ use in the right paracentral gyrus, and they observed
      consistent positive relationships in various brain regions between age of MJ
      onset and thickness. In the only other known adolescent study of cortical thickness
      and MJ, Lopez-Larson and colleagues studied 18 adolescent heavy MJ users (similar
      in age and MJ onset as  ) and reported mixed findings of increased thickness
      in prefrontal/insula regions and decreased thickness in posterior/temporal lobe
      areas in the MJ users compared to controls. In contrast to  ,   found areas
      of the frontal lobe and insula that were thinner with increased urine THC metabolites
      and thicker with earlier age of onset. Select findings from the current study
      align with aspects of both of these studies, with a consensus supporting findings
      of a negative dose-dependent relationship between MJ use and cortical thickness.
      Given the low availability of studies to compare, this consensus is very limited.
      Although Jacobus et al. and Lopez-Larson et al. found the opposite effect of
      age of onset on thickness, the pattern of divergence among early vs. late onset
      users in the current study is more consistent with the latter study, whereby
      we saw early onset users exhibit thicker cortex with continued MJ use. Taken
      together, findings of increased thickness related to early MJ onset accompanied
      by negative dose-dependent relationships with MJ exposure may reflect two distinct
      processes. One process may be specific to the interactions with cortical development
      during early adolescence, likely leading to a disruption in pruning, and, the
      other, specific to the pharmacological effect with heavy chronic MJ use. \\n\\nIn
      the only known study to examine the curvature-morphology of the cortex in adult
      MJ users,   identified decreased sulcal concavity and thinner sulci in 23\_MJ
      users compared to controls (  n  \_=\_44), also in prefrontal areas. However,
      they did not observe significant relationships with age, MJ onset age, or cumulative
      MJ use. It is interesting that the authors detected group level differences
      (MJ vs. controls) but no correlations with MJ use characteristics such as dose
      or age of onset, whereas our primary findings are the consistent effects of
      continued MJ use differing after early or late adolescent onset. There are substantial
      methodological explanations for this disparity. For example, the current study
      did not compare morphology in MJ users to a normative control sample, therefore,
      it is feasible that group-level differences may emerge with such a comparison.
      Likewise, we deliberately covaried for current age in order to control for brain
      changes with aging and thus optimize our interrogation of developmental effects
      of early onset age and of aspects of continued use. \\n\\nThe heterogeneity
      of MJ effects clearly suggests a multifactorial system of neurobiological processes
      involved. The primary results uphold that age of onset is a robust variable
      that differentiates heavy MJ users based on early versus late MJ onset. However,
      this group distinction relied on current use characteristics. Therefore, in
      the absence of group-level differences, the interactions between onset age and
      current use indicates that continued cannabis exposure and early adolescent
      developmental factors both contribute to a dynamic and sustained departure from
      what is expected based on developmental studies. \\n\\nTypical synaptic refinement
      processes during early adolescence are in the context of long-term depression
      and potentiation of cortical neurons in order to facilitate neuronal remodeling.
      Thus, the normal course of early adolescent development is uniquely vulnerable
      to disruption by MJ due to the electrochemical conditions and maturity of brain
      processes that would not present together again. Cass and colleagues tested
      the sensitivity of early adolescence cannabinoid exposure in an animal model
      ( ). They found that acute administration of cannabinoid agonists in early,
      middle and late adolescent rats led to a state of frequency-dependent disinhibition
      of neurons in the frontal cortex in the early-to-middle adolescent rats, but
      not in the late adolescent rats. Moreover, the authors also noted that adult
      rats previously exposed to cannabinoid agonists in adolescence displayed comparable
      neuronal disinhibition. Thus, by changing the inhibitory/excitatory landscape
      during adolescence, MJ can influence lasting changes to typical cortical remodeling
      during sensitive early adolescent years. \\n\\nThe sequence of pruning and myelination
      likely plays a formative role in lasting changes from early adolescent onset
      MJ use. With decreased synaptic elimination, our findings of greater GW border
      contrast may reflect greater proliferation of myelin at the boundary of the
      cortical ribbon where non-pruned synapses remained with linked axons. Findings
      of altered white matter tissue qualities are mixed in adolescent and adult MJ
      user samples. Some report both increases and decreases in fractional anisotropy
      (FA) and average water diffusion ( ) whereas others report consistent decreases
      in FA among adolescent MJ users ( ,  ) or null findings ( ). Two studies of
      diffusion tensor imaging in adult MJ users reported reduced FA in users compared
      to controls ( ,  ). In addition to equivocal findings, research is needed to
      address the microstructural changes that could result in altered definition
      of the cortical ribbon. For example, rather than whole brain techniques that
      assess diffusion measures along major white matter tracts, indices assessing
      axonal organization along radial and interneuron association fibers along the
      cortical ribbon are needed. This scenario played out could result in increased
      gray matter (thicker cortex from disrupted pruning) and the myelination of connections
      to these spared terminals would result in increased density of white matter
      at the cortical boundary. Without any known studies of adolescent development
      of the gray/white tissue contrast at the cortical border to serve as a point
      of comparison, we speculate that early adolescent disruption of pruning and
      subsequent myelination of connections at the cortical boundary would be reflected
      by increased GWR as we saw in the current study. \\n\\n\\n## Limitations and
      conclusions \\n  \\nThe cross-sectional nature of this study limits causal attributions
      in terms of what we can infer to be directly related to the effects of MJ. Although
      a longitudinal design is optimal for addressing brain changes directly due to
      MJ, cross-sectional studies facilitate data-driven hypotheses that can be assessed
      directly in prospective studies. \\n\\nIt is important to keep in mind that
      the participants were not explicitly asked for possible years of abstinence
      during their period of regular use, which may have created possible inflation
      in reported duration of regular use. However, because the participants provided
      number of years of \u201Cregular\u201D marijuana use, this inherently suggests
      continued, uninterrupted years of use. Concurrent nicotine use could have also
      influenced our reported results. But in the absence of a larger sample size
      and the presence of huge variance in nicotine use in the current sample, we
      were unable to verify the effect of nicotine use in the reported results. \\n\\nInterpretation
      of these findings is also limited by the lack of behavioral anchors for the
      observed morphological effects and lack of information on other aspects of developmental
      history that could further characterize the effects of marijuana during neurodevelopment.
      This is further limited by the absence of \u201Cexpected\u201D patterns based
      on normative data. Given the varied directions of effects and the small sample
      size, these findings should be replicated and be viewed as preliminary. \\n\\nTo
      conclude, early MJ use was linked to altered neurodevelopmental patterns in
      brain regions sub-serving higher-order cognitive process. Clinical implications
      include need for early, targeted intervention. Given that the most robust results
      were related to interactions between onset age and continued use through emerging
      adulthood, harm reduction approaches may be effective in moderating adolescent
      MJ use to levels that are less likely to cause long-term developmental changes.

      the meaning of abstract mathematical symbols is a cornerstone of arithmetic
      learning in children. Studies have long focused on the role of spatial intuitions
      in the processing of numerals. However, it has been argued that such intuitions
      may also underlie symbols that convey fundamental arithmetic concepts, such
      as arithmetic operators. In the present cross-sectional study, we used fMRI
      to investigate how and when associations between arithmetic operators and brain
      regions processing spatial information emerge in children from 3rd to 10th grade.
      We found that the mere perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign elicited grade-related
      increases of spatial activity in the right hippocampus. That is, merely perceiving
      \u2018+\u2019 signs \u2013 without any operands \u2013 elicited enhanced hippocampal
      activity after around 7th grade (12\u201313 years old). In these children, hippocampal
      activity in response to a \u2018+\u2019 sign was further correlated with the
      degree to which calculation performance was facilitated by the preview of that
      sign before an addition problem, an effect termed operator-priming. Grade-related
      increases of hippocampal spatial activity were operation-specific because they
      were not observed with \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs, which might evoke rote retrieval
      rather than numerical manipulation. Our study raises the possibility that hippocampal
      spatial mechanisms help build associations between some arithmetic operators
      and space throughout age and/or education.Keywords: Arithmetic, Development,
      Attention, Space, fMRI, Hippocampus1.\u2003IntroductionHumans are unique in
      their ability to represent abstract mathematical concepts by culturally invented
      symbols, such as Arabic numerals and arithmetic signs. Because these symbols
      are arbitrary, learning the relationship between their identity and the concept
      they represent is a challenge during early math education in children. Most
      prior studies have focused on the mechanisms supporting the acquisition of symbols
      representing numerical quantities (Piazza et al., 2007, Ansari, 2008, Holloway
      and Ansari, 2009, Lyons and Ansari, 2009, Mundy and Gilmore, 2009). However,
      efficient processing of symbols that convey fundamental arithmetic concepts
      (i.e., operators) may be an important and largely neglected aspect of arithmetic
      skills. This is suggested by the operator-priming effect (Roussel et al., 2002,
      Fayol and Thevenot, 2012, Mathieu et al., 2017), whereby the anticipated presentation
      of a \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019 sign 150\_ms before a single-digit addition
      or subtraction problem facilitates problem-solving in adults.What aspect of
      the processing of an operator may cause the operator-priming effect in adults?
      A first possibility is that an arithmetic sign may automatically evoke a network
      of facts. For example, the perception of a \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019 sign
      might pre-activate a network of additive or subtractive facts that would have
      been built in declarative memory after years of practice (Campbell and Xue,
      2001, Ashcraft, 1992). Pre-activating such a network would facilitate the retrieval
      of the answer from memory when operands are presented. A second possibility
      is that an arithmetic sign may prime a specific procedure that would have been
      \u201Cautomatized\u201D after its repeated practice during arithmetic learning.
      For instance, Fayol and Thevenot argued that perceiving a \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019
      sign might trigger an automatized procedure that could be \u201Clinked to the
      convocation of the mental number line and could correspond to a preparation
      for a quick left-to-right or right-to-left browsing of this mental line\u201D
      (Fayol and Thevenot, 2012). This proposal echoes the idea that adding or subtracting
      numbers involves rightward and leftward shifts of attention from a source to
      a target number along a mental map of numbers oriented from left to right, i.e.,
      the mental number line (MNL) (Hubbard et al., 2005, Masson and Pesenti, 2014,
      Mathieu et al., 2016, Pinheiro-Chagas et al., 2017). Pre-activating such a procedure
      would result in a facilitation of subsequent calculation when operands are presented,
      thereby explaining the operator-priming effect.Interestingly, two lines of evidence
      favor the procedural over the declarative interpretation of the operator-priming
      effect. First, the effect is not observed with the \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign and
      multiplication problems (Roussel et al., 2002, Mathieu et al., 2017). Multiplication
      problems, however, are explicitly learned by rote in school and multiplication
      is unanimously viewed as the operation having the strongest association with
      a network of facts in memory (Campbell and Xue, 2001, Galfano et al., 2003,
      Thibodeau et al., 1996). Therefore, the lack of operator-priming effect for
      multiplication problems is difficult to reconcile with the idea that the effect
      is due to associations between operators and networks of stored facts. Second,
      in line with Fayol and Thevenot\u2019s proposal that \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\u2212\u2019
      signs may prime a spatial scanning of the MNL, a recent study suggests that
      \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\u2212\u2019 signs do evoke spatial intuitions. Specifically,
      Pinhas et al. (2014) found that, when instructed to categorize \u2018+\u2019
      and \u2018\u2212\u2019 signs with left-hand or right-hand responses, adults
      tend to respond faster to \u2018+\u2019 signs with the right hand than with
      the left hand, whereas they tend to respond faster to \u2018-\u2019 signs with
      the left hand than with the right hand (Pinhas et al., 2014). Thus, \u2018+\u2019
      and \u2018\u2212\u2019 signs appear to have some automatic associations with
      the right and left sides of space, respectively.Using fMRI, we recently found
      that such spatial associations may stem from the fact that some arithmetic operators
      are automatically processed in brain regions involved in spatial attention in
      adults. We showed that the mere perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign elicits greater
      activity than the mere perception of a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign in brain regions
      underlying overt spatial attention. These included the frontal eye fields (FEF)
      and the posterior superior parietal lobule (PSPL) (Mathieu et al., 2017). Thus,
      perceiving a \u2018+\u2019 sign (but not a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign) may be associated
      with a deployment of spatial attention in educated adults. Therefore, the rightward
      shifts of attention that have been posited to underlie addition problem-solving
      (Hubbard et al., 2005, Masson and Pesenti, 2014, Mathieu et al., 2016) might
      be primed by the mere preview of the addition sign (but not by the preview of
      a multiplication sign because multiplication is typically learned by rote and
      unlikely to be associated with movements along the MNL). Overall, there is mounting
      evidence that at least some arithmetic operators (e.g., \u2018+\u2019 but not
      \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs) evoke spatial intuitions in adults, and that these intuitions
      may relate to the operator-priming effect.However, associations between operators
      and space are arguably not innate. Therefore, a fundamental outstanding question
      is how and when such associations emerge in the developing brain. To answer
      that question, we studied 34 children from 3rd to 10th grade while they performed
      3 tasks. First, fMRI activity was measured while children were instructed to
      make eye saccades towards visually presented targets. This allowed us to precisely
      localize several regions of interest (ROIs) involved in spatial attention across
      children. Second, fMRI activity was measured in these spatial attention ROIs
      while children were presented with trials in which a \u2018+\u2019 sign was
      displayed without any operands (hereafter addition sign-only trials). As in
      our previous study in adults (Mathieu et al., accepted), activity during the
      perception of addition sign-only trials was compared to activity associated
      with trials in which a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign was displayed without any operands
      (hereafter multiplication sign-only trials) because these do not appear to evoke
      any specific intuitions in adults (Fayol and Thevenot 2012). This allowed us
      to identify the spatial attention ROIs in which activity in response to a \u2018+\u2019
      sign (as compared to a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign) increases with age and/or education,
      as well as the developmental time course of these effects.1 Third, outside of
      the scanner, we asked subjects to perform an operator-priming task and measured
      the correlation between inter-individual differences in the size of the operator-priming
      effect and inter-individual differences in sign-related activity in spatial
      attention ROIs as a function of grade. This allowed us to evaluate when sign-related
      activity in spatial attention ROIs leads to an operator-priming effect in children.2.\u2003Material
      and methods2.1. ParticipantsForty-two right-handed children from 3rd to 10th
      grade participated in the study. All were native French speakers. Participants
      did not have prior history of neurological disease, psychiatric disorders, learning
      disabilities or attention deficits. All children and parents provided written
      informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the local
      ethics committee (CPP Sud-Est-II). Families received 80\u20AC for their participation.
      Data from 8 subjects were excluded because of excessive head-movement in the
      scanner (see criteria in the Section 2.7., n\_=\_3), poor whole-brain coverage
      (i.e. susceptibility artefacts from dental braces, n\_=\_3) and unacceptably
      low performance during the task (i.e., lower than 50% accuracy on the sign-plus-operand
      trials, n\_=\_2). Therefore, the final sample consisted of 34 children (20 males)
      from 3rd to 10th grade (age range: 8\u201315, mean age\_=\_11.37, SD\_=\_1.84).
      For each child, a continuous measure of grade was calculated by taking into
      account the specific date within the grade year when that child was scanned.
      The whole sample (n\_=\_34) was evenly split into three groups as a function
      of grade: 11 children were from the \u2018lower grades\u2019 group (grade 3.2\u20135.4;
      mean\_=\_4.4), 11 children were from the \u2018intermediate grades\u2019 group
      (grade 5.6\u20136.9; mean\_=\_6.2), and 12 children were from the \u2018higher
      grades\u2019 group (grade 7.6\u201310.2; mean\_=\_8.5).2.2. Standardized measuresChildren
      were administered standardized tests of intellectual and arithmetic abilities
      to ensure that there were no age differences with respect to those measures.
      Full-scale IQ was measured using the NEMI-2 (Cognet, 2006). Basic arithmetic
      knowledge was evaluated with the Math-Fluency subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson-III
      Tests of Achievement (WJ-III) (Woodcock et al., 2001). Across all participants,
      standardized (i.e., age-normalized) scores on IQ (mean\_=\_112; SD\_=\_10) and
      Math Fluency (mean\_=\_106; SD\_=\_16) tests were within the normal range. One-way
      ANOVAs with the between-subject factor group (lower, intermediate, higher grades)
      revealed no main effect of group on IQ (F(2,31)\_=\_0.591, p\_=\_0.560, BF10\_=\_0.29),
      indicating that age-normalized intellectual abilities were similar across groups.
      However, there was a main effect of group on Math Fluency (F(2,31)\_=\_5.867,
      p\_=\_0.007, BF10\_=\_7.24): Children from intermediate grades had a higher
      age-normalized score (mean\_=\_118; SD\_=\_18) than children from lower (mean\_=\_100;
      SD\_=\_11) and higher grades (mean\_=\_100; SD\_=\_13). Therefore, we included
      standardized Math-Fluency scores as nuisance covariate in all of our analyses.2.3.
      Behavioral sessionAfter standardized testing, children participated in a behavioral
      session during which they performed an operator-priming task adapted from Fayol
      and Thevenot (2012) and Roussel et al. (2002). Children were asked to evaluate
      56 single-digit addition and 56 multiplication problems composed of operands
      between 2 and 9. Problems were presented in both commutative orders. Tie problems
      were excluded. Problems with a sum smaller than or equal to 11 and a product
      smaller or equal to 24 were considered small. Other problems were considered
      large.In each trial, a problem was presented with an answer (Fig. 1a). The arithmetic
      sign was presented either 150\_ms before (Negative SOA condition) or at the
      same time (Null SOA condition) as the operands (Fig. 1a). All problems were
      presented once in both SOA condition with a valid answer. Twenty-eight addition
      and 28 multiplication problems were also presented in both SOA condition with
      an invalid answer (obtained by adding or subtracting 1 to or from the valid
      answer). Trials were pseudorandomly ordered so that no more than three problems
      of the same type appeared consecutively. Problems with an invalid answer were
      randomly chosen across subjects and the order of blocks was counter-balanced
      between subjects. The experiment started with 8 practice trials.Open in a separate
      windowFig. 1Experimental design. (a) During the behavioral session, children
      (n\_=\_34) were asked to evaluate the result of single-digit addition and multiplication
      problems. For both operations, the arithmetic sign was presented either 150\_ms
      before (negative SOA trials), or at the same time as the operands (null SOA
      trials). (b) In the scanner, children (n\_=\_34) performed an arithmetic task
      during which they were presented with sign-only (left) and sign-plus-operands
      (right) addition, multiplication and baseline trials. In each trial, a sign
      (\u2018+\u2019, \u2018\xD7\u2019 or \u2018\u25CA\u2019) was presented at the
      center of the screen for 150\_ms. In sign-only trials, the trial ended with
      the presentation of the sign and was simply followed by the inter-trial period
      of fixation. In sign-plus-operands trials (filler trials), the \u2018+\u2019
      or \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign was immediately followed by a single-digit addition
      or multiplication problem (respectively) presented along an answer and the \u2018\u25CA\u2019
      sign was followed by 3 letters. In those cases, children had 5000\_ms to evaluate
      whether the answer of the problem was true or false or to indicate whether one
      of the 3 letters was a B.The experiment was controlled by Presentation software
      (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA). Problems were displayed in white Arial
      60-point font on a black background. All trials started with the presentation
      of a white central fixation dot for 1500\_ms, immediately followed by a red
      central fixation dot for 1000\_ms signaling that the problem was about to be
      presented, either in the negative SOA condition or in the null SOA condition
      (Fig. 1a). Subjects had a maximum of 5000\_ms to evaluate whether the response
      was valid or invalid as quickly as possible by pressing one of two keys on the
      computer keyboard.2.4. fMRI sessionDuring fMRI scanning, children performed
      a spatial attention localizer task and an arithmetic task. The spatial attention
      localizer task consisted in alternating blocks of fixation and saccades. During
      saccade blocks (n\_=\_9), participants were asked to make saccades towards several
      successive target dots. Each saccade block contained 16 target dots (0.2\xB0
      visual angle) that appeared at random positions with an eccentricity of 3\xB0,
      3.5\xB0, 4\xB0, 4.5\xB0, 5\xB0 or 5.5\xB0 in the left or right visual field
      for an average of 800\_ms (with a jitter of \xB1200\_ms). During fixation blocks
      (n\_=\_9), participants were asked to maintain fixation on a central dot for
      12,800\_ms. Block order was counterbalanced across children.During the arithmetic
      task, children were presented with sign-only and sign-plus-operands versions
      of addition and multiplication trials (Fig. 1b). Each trial started with the
      presentation of either a \u2018+\u2019 or a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign at the center
      of the screen for 150\_ms. In sign-only trials (n\_=\_30), the trial ended with
      the presentation of the sign and was simply followed by the inter-trial period
      of fixation (see below). These sign-only trials were our trials of interest
      and allowed us to isolate neural activity due to the presentation of a sign
      alone. We also included in the experiment sign-plus-operands trials (n\_=\_50).
      In those filler trials, the \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign was immediately
      followed by a single-digit addition or multiplication problem (respectively)
      presented with an answer. Participants were asked to indicate whether the answer
      was true or false. The goal of these filler trials (for which associated activity
      would be difficult to interpret because any effects could be attributable to
      the anticipatory presentation of the operator, the appearance of the operands,
      or a combination of both of these factors) was only to keep children engaged
      and attentive in the scanner. They also induced an arithmetic context, thereby
      ensuring that the \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs presented in sign-only
      trials were perceived as arithmetic signs. Problems in sign-plus-operand trials
      were constructed following the same criteria as in the behavioral session. Finally,
      the baseline consisted in trials in which the arithmetic sign was replaced by
      an abstract non-arithmetic sign (i.e., \u2018\u25CA\u2019). We included 30 baseline
      sign-only trials (in which the \u2018\u25CA\u2019 sign was presented in isolation)
      and 50 baseline sign-plus-operand trials (in which the \u2018\u25CA\u2019 sign
      was followed by 3 letters and participants had to indicate whether one of these
      letters was a B). All trials were followed by a variable period of visual fixation
      ranging from 3000\_ms to 3800\_ms. That period consisted in a central white
      fixation dot that turned red 1000\_ms before the onset of the next trial. The
      arithmetic task was decomposed in 4 functional runs. All trials were intermixed
      and the timing and order of trial presentation within each run was optimized
      for estimation efficiency using optseq2 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/optseq/).
      Behavioral responses were recorded using an MR-compatible response device.Stimuli
      were generated using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany,
      CA). Prior scanning, children were familiarized with the fMRI environment during
      a practice session that took place after the standardized testing and the behavioral
      session. During this practice session, children learned to minimize head movement
      in a mock fMRI scanner. The actual scanning session took place no more than
      3 weeks after the practice session.2.5. Behavioral analysesRT data associated
      with the operator-priming task were normalized using a logarithmic transformation
      prior all analyses to improve the conformity of the data to the standard assumptions
      of parametric testing. Following Fayol and Thevenot (2012), mean RT was analyzed
      using planned comparisons that followed from a within-subject ANOVA with the
      factors Operation (Addition/Multiplication) and SOA (Negative/Null), conducted
      separately for each group. We report for all effects the corresponding Bayes
      factors (BF10), indicating the strength of evidence for the alternative hypothesis
      (H1) relative to the null hypothesis (H0). Substantial evidence in favor of
      the alternative hypothesis is typically suggested by a BF10 greater than 3 (Jeffreys,
      1961, Dienes, 2011).2.6. fMRI data acquisitionImages were collected with a Siemens
      Prisma 3T MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) at the CERMEP
      Imagerie du vivant in Lyon, France. The BOLD signal was measured with a susceptibility
      weighted single-shot EPI sequence. Imaging parameters were as follows: TR\_=\_2000\_ms,
      TE\_=\_24\_ms, flip angle\_=\_80\xB0, matrix size\_=\_128\_\xD7\_120, field
      of view\_=\_220\_\xD7\_206\_mm, slice thickness\_=\_3\_mm (0.48\_mm gap), number
      of slices\_=\_32. A high-resolution T1-weighted whole-brain anatomical volume
      was also collected for each participant. Parameters were as follows: TR\_=\_3500\_ms,
      TE\_=\_2.24\_ms, flip angle\_=\_8\xB0, matrix size\_=\_256\_\xD7\_256, field
      of view\_=\_224\_\xD7\_224\_mm, slice thickness\_=\_0.9\_mm, number of slices\_=\_192.2.7.
      fMRI preprocessingData analysis was performed using SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).
      Functional images were corrected for slice acquisition delays and spatially
      realigned to the first image of the first run. Images were then spatially smoothed
      with a Gaussian filter equal to twice the voxel size. ArtRepair was used to
      help remove motion from the functional images prior to normalization (Mazaika
      et al., 2009). Volumes with rapid scan-to-scan movements of greater than 1.5\_mm
      were repaired by interpolation of the two nearest non-repaired scans. Each run
      with more than 5% of the total number of volumes replaced was removed from the
      analyses. A subject was excluded from further analysis if more than one run
      was removed. The number of volumes replaced did not differ between grade groups
      (F(2,31)\_=\_2.20; p\_=\_0.13). Finally, functional images were normalized into
      the standard MNI space (normalized voxel size, 2\_\xD7\_2\_\xD7\_3.5\_mm3).2.8.
      fMRI processingEvent-related statistical analysis was performed according to
      the general linear model (GLM). For the localizer task, brain activity associated
      with saccades and fixation blocks was modeled as epochs with onsets and offsets
      time-locked to the beginning and the end of each block. Each epoch was convolved
      with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the time series data
      from each run were high-pass filtered (1/128\_Hz). Finally, serial correlations
      were corrected using an autoregressive AR(1) model. Following our previous study
      using the same task in adults (Mathieu et al., 2017), brain activity associated
      with sign-only trials during the arithmetic task was estimated using a finite
      impulse response (FIR) model. We modeled 8 time points with an interval of 2\_s
      (corresponding to one TR) ranging from the onset of the sign to 16\_s after
      the sign. The magnitude of the fMRI response for each type of sign-only trial
      was calculated by subtracting activity at the onset of the sign (i.e., 1st bin,
      or 0\_s after the onset) from the peak activity (i.e., 4th bin, or \u223C8\_s
      after the onset). The time series data from each run were high-pass filtered
      (1/128\_Hz), and serial correlations were corrected using an autoregressive
      AR(1) model.2.9. Region of interest (ROI) definition and analysesThe present
      study used a Region-of-Interest (ROI) approach to analyze brain activity associated
      with sign-only trials in brain regions involved in the orienting of spatial
      attention in children. All ROIs were independently defined using the contrast
      of saccades versus fixation blocks in the spatial attention localizer task.
      All subject-specific contrasts were entered into a random effect (RFX) one-sample
      t-test across subjects. The RFX contrast map was then thresholded across the
      whole-brain using an uncorrected voxel-level threshold of p\_<\_0.001 and a
      false-discovery-rate (FDR) corrected cluster-level threshold of p\_<\_0.05 (Chumbley
      and Friston 2009). Using the SPM toolbox Marsbar (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/),
      ROIs were defined as 6-mm radius spheres around the peak coordinate of each
      region.Within each ROI and for each participant, we calculated the average response
      (parameter estimates) for \u2018+\u2019 signs using the contrast of addition
      sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials. Similarly, we calculated
      the average response for \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs using the contrast of multiplication
      sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials. Two analyses were performed
      in each ROI. First, we identified the ROI(s) in which a difference in fMRI activity
      between \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs emerged throughout age and/or
      education, using a 3\_\xD7\_2 ANOVA with the between-subject factor group (lower/intermediate/higher
      grades) and the within-subject factor sign (\u2018+\u2019/\u2018\xD7\u2019).
      Second, we tested in these ROIs whether inter-individual differences in the
      fMRI response to an arithmetic sign were correlated with inter-individual differences
      in the size of the operator-priming effect (measured in the behavioral session)
      for each group. In all analyses, we report uncorrected P values as well as P
      values corrected for multiple comparisons across all identified ROIs using the
      Bonferroni procedure. Bayes factor are also reported.3.\u2003Results3.1. The
      spatial localizer task activates a brain network encompassing frontal, parietal,
      occipital and hippocampal regionsContrasting saccades to fixation blocks in
      the spatial attention localizer task, we first identified 10 clusters supporting
      the orienting of spatial attention across subjects: the bilateral Frontal Eye
      Field (FEF), bilateral Posterior Superior Parietal Lobule (PSPL), bilateral
      Middle Temporal Gyri (MTG), bilateral Middle Occipital Gyri (MOG), right dorsal
      Inferior Frontal Gyrus (dIFG), and right Hippocampus (see Table 1 and Fig. 2).
      Therefore, a large brain network was involved in the orienting of spatial attention
      across subjects. Each of these regions served as an ROI in subsequent analyses.Table

      The right hippocampus region identified by the spatial localizer task is increasingly
      activated in response to a \u2018+\u2019 sign but not to a \u2018\xD7\u2019
      sign throughout age and/or educationA 3\_\xD7\_2 ANOVA with the between-subject
      factor group (lower/intermediate/higher grades) and the within-subject factor
      sign (\u2018+\u2019/\u2018\xD7\u2019) was then conducted in each of the 10 ROIs
      identified by the spatial attention localizer. We found an interaction between
      group and sign in the right hippocampus (F(2.30)\_=\_6.75, p\_=\_0.0038, pcorr\_=\_0.038;
      Fig. 3a and b), but not in any other ROIs (all Fs\_<\_3.44, all ps\_>\_0.046,
      all pscorr\_>\_0.46). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for
      this interaction in the right hippocampus (BF10\_=\_11.53), while no or anecdotal
      evidence for such an interaction was found in the other ROIs (BF10\_<\_1.63).
      Follow-up t-tests in the hippocampus ROI revealed that children from higher
      grades (average grade\_=\_8.5) exhibited greater activity for addition than
      multiplication sign-only trials (t11\_=\_3.02, p\_=\_0.012), whereas there was
      no difference between signs in children from intermediate grades (average grade\_=\_6.2)
      (t10\_=\_0.87, p\_=\_0.41) and even a trend for less activity for addition than
      multiplication sign-only trials in children from lower grades (average grade\_=\_4.4)
      (t10\_=\_2.22, p\_=\_0.051). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence
      for a difference of activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials
      in children from higher grades (BF10\_=\_5.21), but evidence for this difference
      was absent in intermediate grades (BF10\_=\_0.41) and anecdotal in lower grades
      (BF10\_=\_1.69). Finally, across all groups, addition sign-only trials were
      associated with greater activity than baseline sign-only trials in children
      from higher grades (t11\_=\_2.63, p\_=\_0.023), but not in any other groups
      (all ts\_<\_1.32, all ps\_>\_0.21). Multiplication sign-only trials were associated
      with greater activity than baseline sign-only trials in none of the groups (all
      ts\_<\_1.38, all ps\_>\_0.20). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence
      for a difference between addition sign-only trials and baseline sign-only trials
      in children from higher grades (BF10\_=\_3.00), but no or anecdotal evidence
      in the other groups (all BF10s\_<\_0.60) and for multiplication sign-only trials
      (all BF10s\_<\_0.63). Overall, then, a difference in fMRI response to a \u2018+\u2019
      and a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign emerged throughout age and/or education in the right
      hippocampus.Open in a separate windowFig. 3Grade-related changes of activity

      Difference in activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials
      over grade in the right Hippocampus. *p\_<\_0.05; r represents the Pearson correlation
      coefficient.The findings above were confirmed by an additional correlation analysis
      in which grade was treated as a continuous predictor across all subjects. The
      difference in activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials
      was positively correlated with grade in the right hippocampus (r\_=\_0.53, p\_=\_0.001,
      pcorr\_=\_0.01; Fig. 3c). No other significant grade-related changes were found
      in any other regions (all rs\_<\_0.38, all ps\_>\_0.03, all pscorr\_>\_0.30).
      Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for this correlation in
      the right hippocampus (BF10\_=\_20.97), but no or anecdotal evidence in any
      other ROIs (all BF10s\_<\_2.03). In the right hippocampus, the correlation between
      grade and the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials, was also near significance (r\_=\_0.33, p\_=\_0.056; BF10\_=\_1.22).2
      The correlation between grade and the contrast of multiplication sign-only trials
      versus baseline sign-only trials, however, was not significant (r\_=\_\u22120.18,
      p\_=\_0.32; BF10\_=\_0.35).3.3. Spatial hippocampal activity in response to
      a \u2018+\u2019 sign relates to an addition-priming effect in children from
      higher gradesWe then tested whether the hippocampal response to a \u2018+\u2019
      sign observed in children from higher grades was related to the operator-priming
      effect. To this aim, each child performed a version of the operator-priming
      task outside of the scanner (see Fig. 1a).First, we tested whether the results
      obtained by Fayol and Thevenot (2012) in adults (i.e., an operator-priming effect
      for addition but not for multiplication across subjects) could be extended to
      our children participants. Because children from lower grades had a performance
      close to chance on large problems (58%), we exclusively focused our analyses
      on small problems for which accuracy was significantly above chance in all groups
      (lower grades: 80%, intermediate grades: 92%, higher grades: 96%). Planned comparisons
      revealed an operator-priming effect for addition in children from higher grades
      (1491\_ms versus 1577\_ms; F(1,11)\_=\_8.11, p\_=\_0.016), but not in children
      from lower grades (2289\_ms versus 2417\_ms; F(1,10)\_=\_2.66, p\_=\_0.134)
      and intermediate grades (1530 versus 1509\_ms; F(1,10)\_=\_0.01, p\_=\_0.941).
      No operator-priming effect for multiplication was observed in any groups (lower
      grades: F(1,10)\_=\_3.50, p\_=\_0.091; intermediate grades: F(1,10)\_=\_1.52,
      p\_=\_0.246; higher grades: F(1,11)\_=\_0.14, p\_=\_0.715). Bayes Factor analysis
      indicated substantial evidence for an operator-priming effect with addition
      problems in children from higher grades (BF10\_=\_4.08), but no evidence in
      children from intermediate (BF10\_=\_0.30) and lower (BF10\_=\_0.83) grades.
      There was also no or anecdotal evidence for an operator-priming effect with
      multiplication problems in any group (higher grades: BF10\_=\_0.31; intermediate
      grades: BF10\_=\_0.55; lower grades: BF10\_=\_1.09).Second, we tested whether
      the size of the operator-priming effect in children (measured on small problems)
      was correlated to the magnitude of the response for addition sign-only trials
      versus baseline sign-only trials in the right hippocampus. Such a correlation
      was found to be highly significant in children from higher grades (r\_=\_0.82,
      p\_=\_0.0012, Fig. 4), surviving Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
      between the two conditions and across the three groups (pcorr\_=\_0.007). That
      is, children from higher grades who show greater responses to \u2018+\u2019
      signs in the right hippocampus are those who show larger operator-priming effect
      with addition problems. No significant correlation was found in children from
      lower (r\_=\_0.15, p\_=\_0.66 Fig. 4) and intermediate (r\_=\_0.24, p\_=\_0.48,
      Fig. 4) grades. Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for the
      correlation in children from higher grades (BF10\_=\_38.15), but no evidence
      in children from lower (BF10\_=\_0.40) and intermediate (BF10\_=\_0.46) grades.
      There was also no significant (and anecdotal evidence for a) correlation between
      the operator-priming effect for addition problems and the fMRI response to multiplication
      sign-only trials (compared to baseline sign-only trials) in the right hippocampus,
      in any of the groups (lower grades: r\_=\_0.06, p\_=\_0.87, BF10\_=\_0.37; intermediate
      grades: r\_=\_0.32, p\_=\_0.34, BF10\_=\_0.56; higher grades: r\_=\_0.51, p\_=\_0.09,
      BF10\_=\_1.28). Therefore, not only did we observe an operator-priming effect
      for addition in the only group in which we also observed a greater hippocampal
      response to \u2018+\u2019 than \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs (i.e., children from higher
      grades), but inter-individual differences in the size of the operator-priming
      effect in that group was also related to hippocampal activity.Open in a separate
      windowFig. 4Hippocampus brain-behavior correlation over grade.Activity in the
      right hippocampus in response to addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials as a function of the operator-priming effect calculated in the behavioral
      session for addition problems in children from lower (n\_=\_11; grade 3.2\u20135.4;
      mean grade\_=\_4.4; mean age\_=\_9.4), intermediate (n\_=\_11; grade 5.6\u20136.9;
      mean grade\_=\_6.2; mean age\_=\_11.1) and higher grades (n\_=\_12; grade 7.6\u201310.2;
      mean grade\_=\_8.5; mean age\_=\_13.4). r represents the Pearson correlation
      coefficient.Third, we tested whether the correlation between the operator-priming
      effect and the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials increased over grade. This was done by transforming the correlation coefficient
      in each group to a Fischer\u2019s z score before comparing the groups using
      the cocor package (Diedenhofen and Musch, 2015). Although the correlation was
      not greater in children from intermediate than lower grades (z\_=\_0.19, p\_=\_0.43,
      one-tailed), it was significantly greater in children from higher than lower
      grades (z\_=\_2.07, p\_=\_0.019, one-tailed) and in children from higher than
      intermediate grades (z\_=\_1.88, p\_=\_0.030, one-tailed). Therefore, this brain-behavior
      correlation increased over grade.4.\u2003DiscussionIn the present study, we
      used fMRI and a cross-sectional design to investigate (i) how and when spatial
      processing related to the perception of an addition sign emerges in the developing
      brain, and (ii) to what extent it contributes to the emergence of an operator-priming
      effect.4.1. The mere perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign is associated with increased
      hippocampal spatial activity throughout age and/or educationIt has been shown
      that the processing of a \u2018+\u2019 sign is associated with the right side
      of space (Pinhas et al., 2014) and activates brain regions involved in overt
      spatial attention in adults (Mathieu et al., 2017). Therefore, we expected arithmetic
      learning to be associated with increased recruitment of brain regions involved
      in spatial attention in response to the perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign throughout
      age and/or education in children. This was the case in a region of the right
      hippocampus that we identified in our spatial attention localizer task. Therefore,
      it is possible that hippocampal spatial mechanisms may scaffold the progressive
      association between an arithmetic operator (i.e., a \u2018+\u2019 sign) and
      spatial intuitions throughout age and/or education. There is increasing evidence
      that the hippocampal formation, and particularly the right hippocampus, may
      house a \u2018sense of space\u2019 (Buffalo, 2015). Specifically, the right
      hippocampus has been extensively reported to support spatial representation
      and navigation in humans (Maguire et al., 1998, Burgess et al., 2002) as well
      as in non-human primates and rodents (O'keefe and Nadel, 1978, Bird and Burgess,
      2008). For example, the hippocampus is typically activated when human participants
      learn to navigate through a mental representation of space (i.e., mental scanning)
      (Mellet et al., 2002, Spiers and Maguire, 2006). Interestingly, a recent study
      in monkeys demonstrated that neurons in the hippocampal formation may encode
      the direction of overt (Killian et al., 2015) as well as covert (Wilming et
      al., 2015) shifts of attention. Therefore, the hippocampal formation is likely
      a critical region for both representing a mental map of space and navigating
      along that map (Killian et al., 2012, Meister and Buffalo, 2016).Why would such
      a hippocampal spatial navigation mechanism be increasingly recruited by the
      mere perception of a\u2019+\u2019 sign throughout age and/or education? One
      possibility is that this mechanism might enable children to construct a detailed
      representation of numbers in mental space, as well as to navigate along that
      mental representation. Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence that numbers of
      increasing size are organized along a left-to-right mental map (i.e., the MNL)
      in adults (Fischer and Shaki 2014). This spatial representation may enable individuals
      to add or subtract numbers by navigating from a source to a target number to
      the left or right of that MNL. This is supported by behavioral studies showing
      that addition and subtraction problem-solving is associated with rightward and
      leftward shifts of attention (Masson and Pesenti, 2014, Mathieu et al., 2016),
      as well as by a neuroimaging study indicating an overlap between the brain regions
      involved in overt shifts of attention and those involved in arithmetic calculation
      in adults (Knops et al., 2009). Such strategies may be acquired early by children,
      sometimes even explicitly in the classroom where addition and subtraction is
      often demonstrated on visual number lines. Yet, it is only with practice that
      they might become progressively attached to and evoked by an arithmetic operator
      such as a \u2018+\u2019, which might explain the grade-related increases of
      activity in this region in response to the \u2018+\u2019 sign (and the fact
      that it is only by 7th grade that children exhibit significant activity in response
      to that sign).4.2. Hippocampal spatial activity in response to a \u2018+\u2019
      sign relates to the operator-priming effect in children from higher gradesA
      critical question is to what extent this automatic processing of a \u2018+\u2019
      sign in hippocampal spatial mechanisms is associated with children\u2019s behavior.
      To answer this question, we asked all children to perform a version of the operator-priming
      task developed by Fayol and Thevenot (2012) and Roussel et al. (2002). First,
      we replicated the operator-priming effect observed in adults with addition problems
      (i.e., a facilitation of problem-solving when the operator is presented 150\_ms
      before the operands), but only in children from higher grades (after around
      7th grade). Like in adults, this effect was specific to addition problems and
      not observed with multiplication problems. Thus, the perception of a \u2018+\u2019
      sign (but not that of a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign) appears to pre-activate a process
      that is likely used to solve the subsequent problem in children from higher
      grades. More central to our current interest, we found that the size of the
      operator-priming effect in these children was highly correlated with the degree
      of activation of hippocampal spatial mechanisms in response to a \u2018+\u2019
      sign. This indicates that hippocampal spatial activity may be at the source
      of the operator priming-effect in older children, perhaps because these children
      might prepare for an attentional movement along the MNL as soon as a \u2018+\u2019
      sign is presented. Because no brain-behavior correlation was observed in younger
      children, extensive practice might be needed before such mechanisms are triggered
      by the mere perception of the sign.4.3. Hippocampal spatial activity in response
      to a \u2018+\u2019 sign is transient in developmentStrikingly, the spatial brain
      mechanisms that respond to the mere perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign appear
      to be different in children and adults. That is, albeit we found increased hippocampal
      spatial activity throughout age and/or education in the present study, we did
      not identify these mechanisms in our previous study in adult participants using
      the exact same task (Mathieu et al., 2017). Rather, we found increased activity
      in response to a \u2018+\u2019 sign in neocortical regions of the FEF and PSPL
      in adults. Therefore, the contribution of the hippocampus to the automatic processing
      of a \u2018+\u2019 sign is likely transient. Such a transient involvement of
      the hippocampus is consistent with a wealth of studies that have demonstrated
      that the spatial representations initially supported by the hippocampus during
      learning become independent from this brain structure over experience and transferred
      to neocortical regions (Rosenbaum et al., 2004, Hirshhorn et al., 2012b). For
      example, longitudinal studies demonstrate that right hippocampal activity associated
      with learning to mentally navigate through a new environment disappears and
      is replaced by neocortical activity when individuals become familiar with that
      environment (Spiers and Maguire, 2007, Hirshhorn et al., 2012a). It is possible
      that the same phenomenon is at play here: The hippocampus may be involved in
      the early representation of (and navigation along) the MNL before that representation
      is transferred to neocortical regions of the fronto-parietal cortex. Future
      investigations with a wider age sample than in the present study are needed
      to test this hypothesis.4.4. Can right hippocampal involvement in the present
      study reflect mnemonic operations involved in learning arithmetic?Although there
      is no doubt that the hippocampus supports spatial processing (Burgess et al.,
      2002, Spiers and Maguire, 2007), this brain structure is also well known to
      support the encoding and consolidation of verbal declarative knowledge into
      long-term memory (Eichenbaum, 2004). In fact, previous developmental studies
      have largely explained the involvement of the hippocampus during arithmetic
      learning by referring to its role in declarative memory rather than spatial
      processing (Rivera et al., 2005, De Smedt et al., 2011, Cho et al., 2011, Cho
      et al., 2012, Qin et al., 2014). This interpretation relies on the claim that
      results of well-practiced arithmetic facts (e.g., 2\_+\_3 or 4\_\xD7\_2) might
      become progressively retrieved from memory (rather than calculated) over the
      course of learning and development (Campbell and Xue, 2001). The hippocampus
      might thus support the encoding and consolidation of networks of arithmetic
      facts in children.Can the role of the hippocampus in declarative memory explain
      the operator-specific activity over grade (and correlation with the operator-priming
      effect) observed in the region of the right hippocampus identified by our spatial
      localizer task? We acknowledge that we did not have a task identifying processes
      involved in declarative memory. Thus, even if the right hippocampus is usually
      more associated with spatial than mnemonic processes (Burgess et al., 2002),
      it is possible that the hippocampal cluster that we identified as being involved
      in spatial processing may also be involved in some aspects of declarative memory.
      One might thus argue that grade-related increases of activity in relation to
      \u2018+\u2019 signs reflect the progressive association between a \u2018+\u2019
      and a network of additive facts. This explanation, however, can be ruled out
      by an examination of activity related to \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs. Because single-digit
      multiplication problems are almost exclusively learned by rote in school, multiplication
      is the operation that is perhaps the most associated with a network of stored
      facts in the literature (Campbell and Xue, 2001). Thus, if increased hippocampal
      activity in relation to \u2018+\u2019 signs were due to the progressive building
      of a network of additive facts, increased activity in that same region should
      have been observed during the perception of \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs (perhaps
      even more so for the perception of \u2018+\u2019 signs). Yet, this is not the
      case. Not only did we not find any grade-related increase of activity for \u2018\xD7\u2019
      signs in the hippocampal cluster identified by our spatial localizer task, but
      activity was significantly greater for \u2018+\u2019 than \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs
      in higher graders (who are as proficient in single-digit multiplication as addition).
      Similarly, no operator-priming effect was observed for multiplication problems
      in higher graders, indicating that the operator-priming effect observed for
      addition is likely to have little to do with the pre-activation of a network
      of stored facts (because this should be also observed for multiplication). Therefore,
      the specificity of our results to \u2018+\u2019 signs (as compared to \u2018\xD7\u2019
      signs) in the right hippocampus ROI makes it very unlikely that our results
      are related to mnemonic operations. In our view, emerging associations between
      \u2018+\u2019 signs and spatial intuitions related to the MNL are the best explanation
      of the effects reported here.Of course, the fact that the role of the hippocampus
      in declarative memory is unlikely to explain our operator-specific findings
      in the right hippocampus ROI does not mean that hippocampal mechanisms supporting
      mnemonic operations do not contribute to arithmetic learning. Instead, they
      indicate that the hippocampus might contribute to arithmetic learning through
      its role in both declarative memory and spatial processing. Interestingly, the
      operator-specific activity observed in our (spatially localized) right hippocampal
      cluster is not observed in a mirror (left lateralized) cluster that is not activated
      in the localizer contrast (see Supplementary information). In that mirror region,
      no difference was observed between activity related to \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\xD7\u2019
      signs in any group of children (and left hippocampal activity was not related
      to the operator-priming effect). Thus, the developmental effect reported here
      appears to be restricted to the right hippocampus. This specificity suggests
      that the observed developmental changes in the right hippocampus may not simply
      reflect general brain maturation but rather mechanisms that are specific to
      arithmetic learning.4.5. LimitationsIt is worth acknowledging here 2 potential
      limitations of the present work. First, as is the case for any cross-sectional
      fMRI studies, our study is correlational in nature. Thus, although our findings
      are consistent with the idea that the right hippocampus might scaffold the progressive
      association between (at least some) arithmetic operators and space throughout
      age and/or education, future studies might specifically investigate the causal
      role of these hippocampal mechanisms. Second, our finding of a correlation between
      grade and the processing of an addition sign in the right hippocampus (see Fig.
      3C) relies on a relatively large sample size of 34 children. However, other
      findings involve subgroups of participants and therefore rely on smaller sample
      sizes. In particular, null findings in relation to these subgroups might be
      difficult to interpret because of potential lack of power. For example, whereas
      we found an operator-priming effect in children from higher grades and no effect
      in children from intermediate grades, there was no significant difference between
      these groups in terms of response times in negative SOA trials (1491\_ms versus
      1530\_ms; t21\_=\_0.21; p\_=\_0.84; BF10\_=\_0.39). Behavioral studies focusing
      on the operator-priming effect in children might test whether this difference
      emerges with larger sample sizes. More generally, future studies are needed
      to improve our understanding of the present results.5.\u2003ConclusionIn sum,
      our findings suggest that the right hippocampus might contribute to the progressive
      association between (at least some) arithmetic operators and space throughout
      age and/or education. Therefore, our study raises the possibility that increased
      hippocampal activity during arithmetic learning in children may be explained
      by the role of this structure in spatial representations as well as in declarative
      memory.Conflict of interestThe authors declare no competing financial interests.AcknowledgmentsThis

      that to induce an arithmetic context and disguise the goal of the experiment,
      we also included trials in which a \u2018\_+\_\u2019 or a \u2018\_\xD7\_\u2019
      sign was followed 150\_ms later by operands and participants were asked to solve
      the problem. The low temporal resolution of fMRI, however, makes it impossible
      to dissociate activity associated with the sign from activity associated with
      operands in these problems. Therefore, they were simply designed to be filler
      trials.2There was a tendency for a correlation between grade and activity associated
      with addition sign-only trials (versus fixation) in the right hippocampus (r\_=\_0.29,
      p\_=\_0.09; BF10\_=\_0.82), but no correlation for baseline sign-only trials
      (versus fixation) (r\_=\_\u22120.10, p\_=\_0.58; BF10\_=\_0.25). Thus, the correlation
      between grade and the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline
      sign-only trials was more likely driven by changes of activity in addition sign-only
      trials than in baseline sign-only trials.Appendix ASupplementary data associated

      seen as instrumentally abusive and emotionally callous, yet social challenges
      often trigger uncontrolled emotional behavior in those individuals. This study
      shows how this paradoxical aspect of psychopathy relates to altered neuroendocrine
      interactions between testosterone and the cerebral circuit coordinating emotional
      action tendencies. The anterior prefrontal cortex, a region necessary for controlling
      emotional behavior, showed blunted responses and reduced connectivity with the
      amygdala in psychopathic criminals engaged in controlling their emotional action
      tendencies. This cerebral pattern was strongest in psychopathic individuals
      with high endogenous testosterone levels. This neuroendocrine signature of altered
      emotional control highlights the relevance of considering the testosterone level
      of individual psychopathic patients during treatment of their impulsive behavior.
      \\n\\n\\n## Introduction \\n  \\nPsychopathy is a disorder often associated
      with blunted emotional responding and increased goal-directed behavior ( ;  ).
      On the other hand, offenders with psychopathy also show a paradoxical increase
      in impulsive behavior and uncontrolled aggression after emotional provocations
      ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), which may be related to heightened testosterone levels (
      ;  ). These two aspects of psychopathy are also distinguished within the most
      commonly used psychopathy checklist, the Psychopathy Check List-Revised (PCL-R),
      potentially reflecting differing traits among psychopathic individuals ( ;  ).
      Importantly, enhanced difficulty in controlling emotional impulses, a crucial
      component of criminal psychopathy associated with PCL-R factor 2, has been largely
      neglected by cognitive neuroscience. Yet, the clinical relevance of this cognitive
      trait is large: reduced behavioral control and increased impulsivity predict
      recidivism in psychopathic offenders ( ), and behavioral control in psychopathic
      offenders appears particularly fragile when dealing with emotionally relevant
      behavior ( ;  , chapter 7;  ). Accordingly, understanding the neurobiological
      systems underlying the altered control of social emotional behavior in psychopathic
      individuals is relevant for improving currently available interventions, which
      are plagued by low treatment response and high recidivism ( ). Here we study
      those neuroendocrine systems in a group of psychopathic offenders engaged in
      an experimental paradigm that requires rule-driven control of emotional behavior.
      \\n\\nPrevious investigations of psychopathy showed altered reactivity to emotional
      material in several brain regions that include the anterior part of the PFC
      (aPFC) and the amygdala ( ;  ;  ). Furthermore, individuals with psychopathy
      showed decreased functional and anatomical connectivity between the PFC and
      amygdala at rest ( ;  ), an indication that these brain regions might have a
      reduced ability to interact effectively. Studies in healthy participants have
      shown that this cerebral circuit is necessary for implementing the control of
      emotionally relevant actions ( ). Namely, aPFC downregulates neural processing
      in the amygdala during emotional control ( ), while high levels of endogenous
      testosterone reduce such control-related connectivity between aPFC and amygdala
      ( ). Those findings raise the possibility that aPFC\u2013amygdala connectivity
      is altered when psychopathic offenders need to control emotionally relevant
      actions, with high levels of endogenous testosterone exacerbating that altered
      connectivity. \\n\\nThis study tests these hypotheses by measuring brain activity
      with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 15 psychopathic criminals
      and 19 matched healthy control subjects dealing with a challenge to control
      their emotional behavior. The psychopathy sample was obtained by focused and
      comprehensive screening excluding confounds that are frequently associated with
      random criminal sampling (e.g., medication use, comorbidity). The social approach\u2013avoidance
      (AA) task was used to provide reliable indexes of control over social emotional
      behavior ( ;  ;  , ). Behaviorally, psychopathic participants previously showed
      altered AA behavior to explicitly approaching and avoiding emotional faces (
      ). Similar findings occurred after testosterone administration in healthy participants
      ( ). Interestingly, a more subtle version of the AA task has been shown to be
      sensitive to testosterone-related alterations and genetic variations in the
      aPFC\u2013amygdala pathway, while keeping behavior constant across experimental
      groups ( ), opening the way for isolating neural vulnerability factors ( ) in
      psychopathy. During this task, participants respond to affective faces (happy,
      angry) presented for a short time with approach and avoidance movements. Automatic
      emotional tendencies (approach\u2013happy and avoid\u2013angry faces; affect-congruent
      response conditions) need to be controlled during affect-incongruent response
      conditions in order to apply the counterintuitive action of approaching angry
      and avoiding happy faces ( ;  ). Healthy participants respond more slowly and
      rely more strongly on the aPFC when emotional control is required, operationalized
      by the differences evoked between affect-incongruent and affect-congruent trials
      ( ;  ). Accordingly, this study tests whether exerting control over emotionally
      relevant actions is reflected by reduced functionality of the aPFC\u2013amygdala
      circuit in psychopathic individuals, suggesting less prefrontal regulation of
      emotional actions. In addition, it sets out to test whether this alteration
      is intensified by high levels of endogenous testosterone. \\n  \\nThe emotional
      control AA task. The AA task involved the presentation of happy and angry faces,
      and the performance of approach and avoidance responses. During the AA task,
      the participants had to select their response according to the perceived emotion
      of the face. At the beginning of each block of 12 trials, the participants received
      instructions on whether to pull the joystick toward themselves (approach) or
      push it away (avoid) when seeing a face with a particular emotion. When viewing
      happy or angry faces, automatic stimulus\u2013response tendencies trigger corresponding
      approach or avoidance actions. These tendencies could be followed during the
      affect-congruent condition (approach\u2013happy, avoid\u2013angry). In contrast,
      when task instructions required participants to avoid happy faces or to approach
      angry faces, automatic tendencies needed to be controlled and overridden with
      the instructed response (affect-incongruent condition). Participants saw the
      faces and moved the joystick while lying in a MR scanner (top left corner of
      the table). Figure adapted from  ). \\n  \\n\\n## Materials and Methods \\n
      \ \\n### Participants \\n  \\nThe psychopathic group was recruited from in-patient
      populations of the Pompestichting and Oldenkotte, forensic psychiatric institutes
      (TBS-clinics) in the Netherlands. TBS-clinics are facilities for criminal offenders
      with a mental disorder treated on behalf of the state. \\n\\nSeventeen male
      psychopathic violent offenders (age range, 23-56 years) participated; all had
      received a diagnosis with a PCL-R score of \u226526, according to European standards
      ( ;  ;  ). PCL-R consensus scores were obtained by trained clinicians based
      on a structured PCL-R interview, clinical status, and history. After the independent
      scoring, the two raters compared their scores and came to the consensus score.
      When no consensus could be found, a third independent rater was included in
      the process. Dutch versions of the National Adult Reading Test and Edinburgh
      Handedness Inventory were used to assess IQ levels and right-handedness ( ;
      \ ). Twenty-one healthy male control subjects (HCs) matched for age, right-handedness,
      and IQ, without criminal records or history of psychiatric disorders, were recruited
      from staff of the clinics. All participants received oral and written information
      about the experiment and gave written informed consent according to guidelines
      of the local ethics committee (Commissie Mensengebonden Onderzoek region Arnhem-Nijmegen).
      Psychiatric exclusion criteria consisted of neurological, axis-I, and axis-II
      disorders, besides antisocial personality disorder for the psychopathic group.
      They were screened for these exclusion criteria by trained psychologists using
      Dutch versions of the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID;  ) and Mini-International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI;  ) for   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      of Mental Disorders  , 4th edition, disorders. All participants were asked about
      drug use and medical/neurological history to exclude the following: alcohol
      use of >3 units/day, cannabis, or other illicit drug use 1 week before, psychotropic
      medication other than oxazepam 5 d before, 1 unit of alcohol or oxazepam use
      within 24 h before the experiment; history of trauma capitis; visual and auditive
      disorder; and neurological disorder. Furthermore, general exclusion criteria
      for MRI experiments were applied. Two psychopathic patients (PPs) and two HCs
      were excluded from the analyses, due to incomplete scanning procedures (1 PP,
      1 HC) or too many errors on the task (>16%, representing the outlier with a
      \  z  -score >3). The final groups did not differ in age, IQ, and handedness
      (see  ). \\n  \\nDemographical data \\n    \\n\\n### Procedure \\n  \\nTwo test
      sessions took place. During the first session, right-handedness, IQ, MINI, and
      SCID were assessed. During the second session, participants completed several
      questionnaires upon arrival in the laboratory, including the State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory (STAI) to measure anxiety levels ( ). Next, they provided saliva for
      the testosterone measurement. Afterward, participants were positioned in the
      1.5 T MR scanner and familiarized with the task setup. Immediately after this,
      the fMRI session started with the AA task (duration, 30 min) followed by another
      task (not included in this report). After a short break outside the scanner,
      the anatomical scan (duration, 5 min) and an unrelated task were acquired in
      the side-by-side 3 T MR scanner. \\n\\n\\n### Experimental task \\n  \\nThe
      AA task consisted of 24 blocks (with 12 trials per block and a baseline period
      of 21-24 s) during which participants had to respond to visually presented faces
      either by pulling a joystick toward themselves (approach) or by pushing it away
      from themselves (avoid;  ). The participants had to categorize faces as happy,
      angry, and neutral (filler items), based on their affective expressions. During
      each block, two of the three affective expressions were presented as stimuli,
      because only two responses could be given to categorize the stimulus. This resulted
      in six different block types each used four times, representing the affect (happy\u2013angry,
      happy\u2013neutral, angry\u2013neutral) \xD7 movement (approach\u2013avoid)
      combinations. At the start of each block, participants received written instructions
      regarding the required response mapping. The affect \xD7 movement combinations
      were pseudorandomly and evenly distributed (with no affect combination repetition),
      and the combination of the first block was counterbalanced across participants.
      Within each block, affective expressions and gender types were pseudorandomly
      presented, avoiding three or more sequential presentations of the same expression/gender,
      and two presentations of the same facial model. Each face was presented for
      100 ms, preceded by a 300 ms blank screen, and followed by the participant\u2019s
      response, a blank screen, and by a pseudorandom intertrial interval (ITI; 1-3
      s). A baseline period of 21-24 s preceded each block. The faces were from 36
      models (18 male) obtained from several databases ( ;  ;  ; ), each showing all
      expressions. The pictures were in grayscale, matched for brightness and contrast
      values, and displayed against a black background. To exclude influence from
      hair and nonfacial contours, the faces were trimmed. Joystick displacements
      of >80% along the sagittal plane within 2 s from stimulus presentation were
      marked as valid responses. Invalid responses were signaled for 1 s with written
      feedback stating \u201Cyou did not move your joystick far enough.\u201D After
      moving the joystick, participants had to return to the starting position (defined
      as the central area extending 20% along the sagittal plane) before the end of
      the ITI. Otherwise, visual feedback indicated \u201Creturn the joystick to the
      starting position,\u201D and the ITI was repeated after participants returned
      the joystick. The training at the beginning consisted of six blocks; one block
      of eight trials for each of the six affect \xD7 movement combinations. Different
      visual stimuli were used during the training and scanning blocks. \\n\\n\\n###
      Materials and apparatus \\n  \\nThe fMR images were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI
      scanner (Avanto, Siemens Medical Systems) with an eight-channel head coil using
      a multiecho generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA)
      sequence [ ; repetition time (TR), 2.14 ms; five echo times (TEs), 9.4/21/33/44/56
      ms; 34 transversal slices; ascending acquisition; distance factor, 17%; effective
      voxel size, 3.3 \xD7 3.3 \xD7 3.5 mm; field of view (FOV), 212 mm]. High-resolution
      anatomical images were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner with a 32-channel head
      coil using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (TR, 2300 ms;
      TE, 3.03 ms; 192 sagittal slices; voxel size, 1.0 \xD7 1.0 \xD7 1.0 mm; FOV,
      256 mm). \\n\\nAn MR-compatible joystick (Fiber Optic Joystick, Current Designs;
      sampling rate, 550 Hz) was placed on participants\u2019 abdomens to ensure comfortable
      push-and-pull movements ( ). Participants wore MR-compatible headphones to reduce
      scanner noise (Commander XG MRI Audio System, Resonance Technologies). Stimuli
      were projected at the center of a screen, viewed via a mirror above the participant\u2019s
      head, with a visual angle of 4\xB0 \xD7 6\xB0 (width \xD7 height). Stimuli presentation
      and acquisition of joystick positions were controlled by a PC running Presentation
      version 13 ( ). \\n\\n\\n### Salivary measurements \\n  \\nParticipants filled
      two Salicaps (IBL) with saliva for testosterone measurement, which were stored
      at \u221225\xB0C. Testosterone concentration was measured using competitive
      chemiluminescence immunoassay with a sensitivity of 0.0025 ng/ml (IBL International,
      Tecan). Intra-assay and interassay coefficients are between 10% and 12%. To
      control variables influencing testosterone levels, participants were instructed
      to refrain from any food, cigarettes, and drinks (except water) for 1 h before
      the experiment. \\n\\n\\n### Behavioral analysis \\n  \\nBehavioral data was
      analyzed using MATLAB version 7.9 (MathWorks) and PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc.).
      First, to obtain a precise measure of movement onset [reaction time (RT)], the
      joystick movement for each trial was reconstructed using the joystick displacement
      measurements. Excluded trials showed a joystick movement in the wrong direction,
      an extreme RT (<150 or >1500 ms), peak velocity (<0.1 cm/s), or movement time
      (>400 ms); or an error rate of above chance level in a block (in that case,
      the whole block was excluded). RTs and testosterone levels were log transformed
      to obtain a normal distribution. Second, following previous studies ( ;  ),
      we conducted three-way repeated-measures ANOVA (ANCOVArm) on the mean RT and
      error rates, with factors group (PP, HC), movement (approach, avoid), and valence
      (happy, angry), including standardized testosterone and STAI state as covariate.
      A measure of anxiety (STAI) was included to account for the effects of psychopathy
      type (e.g., primary vs secondary); and the possible effects on emotional behavior,
      hormonal levels, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex functioning ( ;  ;  ; ). The
      \u03B1-level was set at   p   < 0.05. \\n\\n\\n### Functional MRI data \\n  \\n####
      Single-subject analyses \\n  \\nImaging data were preprocessed and analyzed
      using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping;  ). The first four volumes of each
      participant\u2019s dataset were discarded to allow for   T   equilibration.
      Given the multiecho GRAPPA MR sequence (Poser et al., 2006), head motion parameters
      were estimated on MR images with the shortest TE (9.4 ms), since these are least
      affected by possible artifacts. These motion correction parameters, estimated
      using a least-squares approach with six rigid body transformation parameters
      (translations, rotations), were applied to the five echo images collected for
      each excitation. After spatial realignment, the five echo images were combined
      into a single MR volume using an optimized echo weighting method (Poser et al.,
      2006). The time series for each voxel was temporally realigned to the first
      slice in time. The   T  -weighted image was spatially coregistered to the mean
      of the functional images. The fMRI time series were transformed and resampled
      at an isotropic voxel size of 2 mm into standard Montreal Neurological Institute
      (MNI) space by unified segmentation and normalization using the coregistered
      \  T  -weighted image ( ). The normalized functional images were spatially smoothed
      using an isotropic 8 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. \\n\\nThe
      fMRI time series of each subject were further analyzed using an event-related
      approach in the context of general linear model, including the following effects:
      approach\u2013happy, approach\u2013neutral, approach\u2013angry, avoid\u2013happy,
      avoid\u2013neutral, and avoid\u2013angry. Trials excluded from behavioral analyses
      and periods of instructions or feedback were modeled as regressors. Vectors
      describing the time of picture presentation (onset) and RT of each event (duration)
      were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Potential confounding
      effects of residual head movement were modeled using original, squared, cubic,
      first-order, and second-order derivatives of the movement correction parameters
      ( ). Three further regressors, describing the time course of signal intensities
      of white matter, CSF, and the portion of the MR image outside the skull were
      also added. This procedure accounts for image intensity shifts due to hand movements
      within or near the magnetic field of the scanner ( ). Finally, fMRI time series
      were high-pass filtered (cutoff 120 s). Temporal autocorrelation was modeled
      as a first-order autoregressive process. \\n\\n\\n#### Group analyses \\n  \\nConsistent
      effects across participants and between groups were tested using a random-effects
      multiple regression analysis that included six contrast images (approach\u2013happy,
      approach\u2013neutral, approach\u2013angry, avoid\u2013happy, avoid\u2013neutral,
      avoid\u2013angry) per participant. Together, these images represented the estimated
      cerebral effects from 12 conditions of the experimental design [group (PP, HC)
      \xD7 valence (happy, neutral, angry) \xD7 response (approach, avoid)]. Standardized
      log-transformed testosterone and standardized STAI state levels were included
      in the multiple regression analysis as condition-specific [group (PP, HC) \xD7
      valence (happy, neutral, angry) \xD7 response (approach, avoid)] regressors,
      generating another 12 regressors per variable. \\n\\nAll analyses assessed the
      congruency effect, reflecting task-related differences of affect-incongruent
      (approach\u2013angry, avoid\u2013happy) versus affect-congruent trials (approach\u2013happy,
      avoid\u2013angry;  ;  ). We considered two effects. First, to test for general
      effects of congruency, we performed an analysis on the congruency effect over
      both groups and for each group separately. When assessing the effects of one
      group explicitly, we also tested whether those effects were specific to that
      group and were significantly weaker in the other group (at   p   < 0.05 uncorrected)
      by masking the statistical map describing the congruency effect in the first
      group (using multiple comparisons correction, see below) with the statistical
      map describing the group \xD7 congruency contrast. Second, to test whether testosterone
      differentially modulated the control of emotionally relevant actions in the
      groups, we performed a group \xD7 congruency contrast on the regressor parametrizing
      interindividual differences in testosterone on task-related conditions. If such
      an interaction is present, the testosterone modulation on the congruency effect
      of each group separately is considered. In addition to whole-brain analyses,
      we used a volume of interest (VOI) on coordinates previously found to be modulated
      by testosterone during the congruency effect in healthy students (two 8-mm-radius
      spheres centered on the following MNI coordinates:   x  , \u221230;   y  , 58;
      and z, 2; and   x  , 32;   y  , 54; and   z  , 8;  ). \\n\\nThe reported activations
      are corrected for multiple comparisons using familywise error (FWE) correction.
      For whole-brain analyses, we made inferences at cluster level (FWE:   p   <
      0.05, corresponding to a cluster size of >140 on the basis of intensity threshold,
      \  p   < 0.001). For VOI analyses, we made inferences at voxel-level (FWE corrected,
      \  p   < 0.05;  ;  ). Anatomical inference is drawn by superimposing SPM showing
      significant signal changes on structural images of participants. For anatomical
      accuracy, we report only activation peaks in gray matter. Anatomical landmarks
      were identified using the atlas of  . Brodmann areas (BAs) were assigned by
      superimposing significant SPM on the SPM anatomy toolbox ( ) and MRIcron template
      ( /). \\n\\n\\n\\n### Connectivity analyses \\n  \\nThe aim of the following
      analysis was to test whether inter-regional coupling of the aPFC (see Results)
      with the amygdala and other brain regions during the congruency effect was different
      between the groups and modulated by testosterone. To test for these effects,
      we used the psychophysiological interactions (PPIs) method ( ). More specifically,
      we tested for significant differences between the regression coefficients of
      each voxel over the right aPFC during the affect-incongruent versus the affect-congruent
      conditions. To select voxels to be included in the VOI, we used the following
      anatomical constraints ( ): for each participant, selected voxels fell within
      a sphere with a radius of 4 mm around the peak voxel corresponding to the activated
      cluster of the congruency effect over both groups (coordinates:   x  , 30;   y
      \ , 58;   z  , 14; see Results). Participant specific contrast images were generated
      describing the PPI between the time courses of the right aPFC VOI and affect-incongruent
      versus affect-congruent conditions. Group differences and testosterone modulations
      on task-related coupling between the aPFC and other regions were then assessed
      using a multiple regression design on participant-specific contrast images with
      their corresponding testosterone (log-transformed, standardized) and STAI state
      (standardized) levels as subject- and group-specific regressors. In addition
      to whole-brain analyses, we assessed significant voxel-level effects (FWE corrected
      for multiple comparisons,   p   < 0.05) within the amygdala, defined on the
      Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas ( ) using the WFU PickAtlas tool ( ). \\n\\n\\n\\n##
      Results \\n  \\n### Behavioral results \\n  \\nFifteen psychopathic criminals
      (PPs; PCL-R score of \u226526, according to European standards ( ;  ;  ) and
      19 HCs (for demographics, see  ) were included in the analyses. Participants
      performed the task accurately and consistently (error rates: PPs, 7.9%; HCs,
      7.3%; omissions: PPs, 1.6%; HCs, 1.5%; undefined responses: PPs, 0.9%; HCs,
      0.3%;  ). \\n  \\nRTs and error rates for each group and factor of the AA task
      \\n    \\nA significant movement \xD7 valence interaction for the RTs indicated
      that, over groups, participants responded more slowly during affect-incongruent
      (approach\u2013angry, avoid\u2013happy) than during affect-congruent trials
      (approach\u2013happy, avoid\u2013angry;   F   = 10.4,   p   = 0.003;  ). This
      congruency effect replicates the behavioral results from previous fMRI studies
      ( ;  ). Furthermore, there were main effects of movement (  F   = 26.3,   p
      \  < 0.001) and valence (  F   = 28.7,   p   < 0.001), reflecting the slowing
      of avoidance movements and responses to angry faces in general ( ). There were
      no significant effects involving group, including no main effect (  p   > 0.3).
      The congruency effect correlated positively (without corrections for multiple
      comparisons) with the PCL-R total score (  p   = 0.048,   R   = 0.517, respectively).
      Excluding anxiety from the analyses did not affect the outcomes. Moreover, when
      including the neutral conditions in the analyses, the movement \xD7 valence
      (happy, neutral, angry) interaction for RTs remained significant (  F   = 5.5,
      \  p   = 0.010), showing that neutral approach\u2013avoidance effects are intermediary
      compared with happy and angry ( ). \\n  \\nBehavioral results. Mean RTs (\xB1SEM)
      for the affect-congruent and affect-incongruent conditions of the AA task for
      the healthy control subjects and psychopathic offenders. The groups were significantly
      slower to provide affect-incongruent responses (approach\u2013angry; avoid\u2013happy)
      than affect-congruent responses (approach\u2013happy; avoid\u2013angry), with
      no significant group differences. \\n  \\nFor the error rates, the three-way
      ANCOVArm showed main effects of movement (  F   = 27.5,   p   < 0.001), valence
      (  F   = 25.9,   p   < 0.001), and testosterone (  F   = 4.6,   p   = 0.040),
      and a valence \xD7 testosterone interaction (  F   = 4.3,   p   = 0.047). There
      were no other significant effects for the error rates (  p   > 0.15). \\n\\nEndogenous
      testosterone levels [median (SD): PPs, 101 pg/ml (70 pg/ml); HCs, 90 pg/ml (46
      pg/ml)] and state anxiety levels [STAI mean (SD): PPs, 32 (8); HCs, 32 (5)]
      did not differ between groups (  p   > 0.4), and showed no correlations with
      psychopathy (PCL-R) scores or with each other (  p   > 0.1). \\n\\n\\n### fMRI
      results \\n  \\n#### Multiple regression analyses \\n  \\nTo assess the two
      main questions of this study, we isolated cerebral structures showing stronger
      responses during affect-incongruent than affect-congruent trials (congruency
      effect), and cerebral structures in which the congruency effect was modulated
      by testosterone levels. \\n\\nThe results showed a significant congruency effect
      across groups in the aPFC [ROI analysis: MNI coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z
      \ ): (30, 58, 14) and (\u221230 58 10);   p   = 0.001 and 0.036;   t   = 4.46
      and 3.43; for further details, see  ]. As expected, this effect was driven by
      the healthy control group, and it was significantly weaker in the psychopathic
      offenders [  p   = 0.001 and 0.040;   t   = 4.58 and 3.40, on the congruency
      effect in healthy control subjects masked implicitly by group (HC > PP) \xD7
      congruency interaction]. The implicit masking demonstrates that the group \xD7
      congruency interaction is also significant at   p   < 0.05 within the significant
      voxels corrected for multiple comparisons on the HC congruency effect. The psychopathy
      group showed no significant congruency effect in this region (  p   > 0.3).
      There was also a significant congruency effect across groups in the right superior
      parietal lobule (whole-brain analysis); this effect was driven mainly by the
      psychopathy group ( ). \\n  \\nClusters showing significantly larger activity
      for the affect-incongruent vs the affect-congruent conditions (emotion-control
      effect) \\n    \\nCritically, testosterone modulated the congruency effect in
      the aPFC differently in psychopathic offenders and healthy control subjects
      (whole-brain analysis on testosterone \xD7 group \xD7 congruency: MINI coordinates
      (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ): (30, 58, 12);   p   < 0.001;   t   = 5.10; for all details,
      see  ).   Post hoc   analyses revealed that, in the psychopathy group, congruency
      effects decreased as testosterone levels increased [MNI coordinates (  x  ,
      \  y  ,   z  ): (32, 56, 10) and (\u221230, 58, 8);   p   = 0.002 and 0.015;
      \  t   = 4.34 and 3.74]. The modulatory effect of testosterone on congruency
      was absent in the healthy control subjects (  p   \u2265 0.05;  ). The whole-brain
      analysis also showed an effect in the right caudate nucleus and right inferior
      supramarginal gyrus, driven by reduced congruency effects as a function of testosterone
      in the psychopathy group ( ;  ). \\n  \\nTestosterone modulations of the cerebral

      There are no outliers [Mahalanobis distances   D     < 4.2 (cutoff at   p   <

      activity for the congruency effect and no modulation by testosterone, while
      in psychopathic offenders endogenous testosterone levels modulate the activity
      of the aPFC and right supramarginal gyrus. \\n  \\n\\n#### Effective connectivity
      analyses \\n  \\nGiven the relevance of aPFC\u2013amygdala connectivity for
      implementing emotional control as evoked by the AA task ( ), we assessed whether
      psychopathy also resulted in altered connectivity along that neural pathway.
      Connectivity analyses using the right aPFC [4-mm-radius sphere; central voxel
      from main analysis (MNI coordinates:   x  , 30;   y  , 58;   z  , 14)] as the
      seed region on the congruency effect indicated a significant group difference
      (PP > HC) with the right amygdala ( ; ROI analysis; extent, 3 voxels;   t   =
      3.82;   p   = 0.027; MNI coordinates of local maxima:   x  , 32;   y  , 0;   z
      \ , \u221216). When testing effects for both groups separately, healthy control
      subjects showed a significant negative coupling between the right aPFC and amygdala
      (ROI analysis; extent: 3 voxels,   t   = 3.70;   p   = 0.036; MNI coordinates
      of local maxima:   x  , 32;   y  , 0;   z  , \u221216), while psychopathic offenders
      showed no differential connectivity effect.   Post hoc   testing on right amygdala
      voxels showing the group interaction (threshold,   p   < 0.05 FWE) indicated
      a significant positive correlation with testosterone over both groups (ROI analysis;
      extent, 1 voxel;   t   = 2.29;   p   = 0.029; MNI coordinates of local maxima:
      \  x  , 32;   y  , 2;   z  , \u221216). There was no correlation between aPFC\u2013amygdala
      connectivity and the PCL-R scores (  p   > 0.2). \\n  \\nGroup difference on

      coupling in the healthy control subjects, which is not present in the psychopathic
      offenders. \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n## Discussion \\n  \\nThis study indicates that
      psychopathic offenders show reduced aPFC activity as well as less aPFC\u2013amygdala
      connectivity during the control of emotional behavior. Emotional control was
      measured by comparing affect-incongruent and affect-congruent approach\u2013avoidance
      responses to emotional faces (congruency effect on the AA task;  ). When healthy
      control subjects exerted emotional control, reaction times, aPFC activity, and
      aPFC\u2013amygdala anticorrelations increased, confirming previous observations
      ( ). In contrast, psychopathic offenders did not show this typical control-related
      pattern of aPFC activity and connectivity. In addition, these effects were significantly
      modulated by endogenous testosterone. Namely, psychopathic individuals with
      relatively lower testosterone levels showed a neural activity and connectivity
      pattern that resembled the findings in healthy control subjects, while this
      pattern was absent in those with higher testosterone levels. This indicates
      that especially psychopathic individuals with high testosterone levels have
      less prefrontal regulation of amygdala-driven emotional actions when the control
      of emotional behavior is required. \\n\\n### Emotional control in psychopathy
      \\n  \\nImaging studies have illustrated an association between psychopathy
      and altered processing of fear, including altered amygdala responses ( ;  ;
      \ ), attentional deficits for peripheral stimuli ( ), and moral/empathic insensitivity
      ( ;  ). However, psychopathic offenders also show clear impulsivity problems
      ( ), for example, when control is required during emotionally provoking situations.
      To address this relatively unexplored but crucial component of criminal psychopathy,
      we used a paradigm requiring rule-driven control of emotional actions. With
      this paradigm, it was possible to move beyond simple motor inhibition and to
      target the flexible control of emotionally driven action tendencies. \\n\\nFirst,
      the aPFC (also called BA 10) was less active in psychopathic offenders as a
      function of testosterone. The aPFC is a region crucial for the control of social
      emotional behavior. When aPFC functioning is temporarily disrupted, participants
      have increased difficulty in overriding emotional tendencies with rule-driven
      behavior ( ). Moreover, the aPFC seems especially important for integrating
      and coordinating multiple cognitive processes to facilitate response selection
      ( ;  ). For example, transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced reduction of
      aPFC functioning during the control of emotional behavior decreased activity
      in brain areas associated with rule selection (posterior parietal cortex), while
      both amygdala activity and automatic action tendencies increased ( ). The current
      study indicates that psychopathic individuals with especially high testosterone
      levels recruited the aPFC less when the control of emotional responses was needed.
      This finding suggests that they have reduced coordination of rule-based behavior
      with emotional information. \\n\\nSecond, connectivity between the aPFC and
      amygdala also differed significantly between groups. Healthy control subjects
      showed a negative aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling during the control of social emotional
      behavior, whereas psychopathic individuals showed no significant coupling between
      these regions. Evidence of anatomical connectivity alterations between these
      regions in psychopathic individuals and the relation of that tract to social
      emotional behavior modifications support these findings ( ). Although these
      results cannot resolve the direction of these connectivity effects, a previous
      study ( ) using this paradigm showed an effective connectivity modulation of
      emotional control on the connection from aPFC to amygdala. Also, animal studies
      ( ) suggest strong prefrontal inhibitory connections that control automatic
      amygdala responses. The absence of this aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling in psychopathic
      offenders suggests that in this group the aPFC has a reduced ability to inhibit
      amygdala-driven responses. This study used subtle emotional provocations, but
      stronger emotional events result in stronger amygdala responses, increasing
      the bias for automatic emotional behavior ( ). A lack of prefrontal control
      likely reduces the ability to inhibit these biases and lead to an increased
      expression of automatic emotional actions even when they are not beneficial
      ( ;  ). \\n\\nTestosterone administration studies also illustrated a decoupling
      between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, suggesting that testosterone
      reduces the communication between the PFC and amygdala ( ;  ;  ) and, within
      the AA task, reduces top-down control. The association between testosterone
      levels and enhanced social aggression and dominance seeking, and reduced impulse
      control in the general population ( ;  ;  ) supports the relevance of testosterone
      in this process. Even amygdala responses to angry faces have recently been found
      to be enhanced after testosterone administration and in psychopathic individuals
      ( ;  ;  ). There is a clear association between testosterone and aggression
      after provocation, which has been related to reduced activity in the orbital
      frontal cortex, a region just ventral of the aPFC ( ). Interestingly, psychopathic
      offenders with lower testosterone levels displayed a pattern similar to that
      in healthy control subjects, while the psychopathic individuals with high testosterone
      levels showed less aPFC activity and aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling. This could
      provide a potential vulnerability factor explaining the difference between the
      goal-directed \u201Csuccessful\u201D psychopath and the \u201Cunsuccessful\u201D
      psychopath with reduced impulse control ( ;  ). We hypothesize that especially
      psychopathic individuals with high testosterone levels fail to inhibit amygdala-driven
      action tendencies using the aPFC during the control of emotional behavior.\\n
      \\n\\nEndogenous testosterone levels also modulated control-related activity
      in the supramarginal gyrus and caudate nucleus of the psychopathy group. The
      supramarginal gyrus was previously found to be involved during emotional control
      on the AA task in a healthy student sample ( ). Previous work indicated that
      it plays an important role in action organization ( ), and that psychopathic
      individuals show reduced supramarginal gyrus activity compared with control
      subjects when reasoning about other people\u2019s emotional state ( ). The current
      findings, emphasizing the role of supramarginal gyrus during emotional control
      in psychopathic offenders with low testosterone levels, could indicate the facilitation
      of action preparation in trials with affect-incongruent stimulus\u2013response
      mapping. The caudate nucleus is important for incorporating predicted action
      outcome, when selecting the most beneficial behavioral goal ( ), and has previously
      found to be larger in psychopathy ( ). In light of these findings, our results
      suggest that psychopathic offenders with low endogenous testosterone levels,
      as opposed to those with high testosterone levels, have more interference of
      automatic action tendencies and outcomes associated with the facial emotions
      (e.g., approach\u2013happy) that are opposite to the required actions during
      affect-incongruent trials ( ). \\n\\n\\n### Interpretational issues \\n  \\nIndividuals
      with psychopathy have been suggested to have difficulty recognizing emotional
      expressions. However, this impairment seems quite specific to fear, rather than
      the emotional expressions used here (anger and happiness;  ;  ). Furthermore,
      the groups assessed in this study made comparable numbers of errors, suggesting
      that psychopathic offenders had no special difficulty in recognizing the clear
      emotional expressions used in this study. \\n\\nThis study used a relatively
      subtle manipulation to target the emotional control system. The rationale of
      this choice was to detect neural vulnerability markers without affecting behavioral
      performance. Psychopathic offenders performing a more salient behavioral version
      of the AA task showed reduced avoidance of angry faces ( ). In this study, angry
      faces evoked numerically similar behavioral effects ( ) and, additionally, aPFC
      effects (  post hoc   inspection of extracted parameters). Although these observations
      could be interpreted as a sign that psychopathic offenders have a tendency to
      approach angry faces, those observations were not statistically significant
      between groups [behavioral and aPFC group effects on angry faces:   p   > 0.2;
      \  p   = 0.271;   z   = 2.54, on the angry\u2013congruency effect in healthy
      control subjects masked implicitly by group (HC > PP) \xD7 angry\u2013congruency
      interaction]. Future investigation is needed to directly test whether more provocative
      paradigms induce specific effects for angry faces. A previous study ( ) using
      this fMRI task in participants with genetic susceptibility for developing aggressive
      disorders, also found no group-specific behavioral effects. That study suggested
      that alterations of the aPFC\u2013amygdala pathway might reflect a vulnerability
      factor for psychopathologies. \\n\\nPreviously, endogenous testosterone modulated
      the aPFC and aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling in a sample of healthy students ( ).
      In that study, a different demographic group of healthy control subjects similarly
      showed a testosterone modulation of aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling, but no testosterone
      modulation of aPFC activity. This difference in the strength of testosterone-modulatory
      effects might be related to between-group differences in age (mean healthy control
      subjects, 41; mean students, 22;  ), educational level (staff of forensic psychiatric
      institute vs university students), or general anxiety [STAI trait, lower in
      healthy control subjects of the current study; mean (SD): 29 (4.4) and 34 (6.9),
      respectively;   t   = \u22122.605;   p   = 0.014]. A limitation of this study
      is the modest sample size. Our focus to exclude moderating factors of comorbid
      disorders (except antisocial personality disorder) and recent drug use has the
      advantage that the sample is relatively homogeneous, but future studies using
      larger samples are needed for replication and to define subsamples. \\n\\n\\n###
      Conclusion \\n  \\nPsychopathic offenders showed reduced aPFC activity and aPFC\u2013amygdala
      connectivity during control of emotional actions, suggesting a decreased coordination
      of emotional information during rule-driven behavior. Moreover, endogenous testosterone
      modulated the involvement of these neural mechanisms. Psychopathic offenders
      with high testosterone levels showed less involvement of the aPFC, aPFC\u2013amygdala
      connectivity, supramarginal gyrus, and caudate nucleus, whereas psychopathic
      individuals with low testosterone levels recruited the aPFC in a fashion similar
      to that of healthy control subjects. These findings suggest that a lack of prefrontal
      control during emotional actions may explain enhanced impulsivity in psychopathic
      offenders during emotionally provoking situations. They outline a neuroendocrine
      model underlying impulsive emotional behavior in psychopathy and support the
      relevance of assessing a potential imbalance in testosterone function to guide
      treatment. It remains to be seen whether these neuroendocrine alterations of
      emotional control are also present in highly impulsive or antisocial individuals.

      or latent effects of early adolescent marijuana use across adolescent developmental
      processes remain to be determined.MethodsWe examined cortical thickness, gray/white
      matter border contrast (GWR) and local gyrification index (LGI) in 42 marijuana
      (MJ) users. Voxelwise regressions assessed early-onset (age <16) vs. late-onset
      (\u226516 years-old) differences and relationships to continued use while controlling
      for current age and alcohol use.ResultsAlthough groups did not differ by onset
      status, groups diverged in their correlations between cannabis use and cortical
      architecture. Among early-onset users, continued years of MJ use and current
      MJ consumption were associated with thicker cortex, increased GWR and decreased
      LGI. Late-onset users exhibited the opposite pattern. This divergence was observed
      in all three morphological measures in the anterior dorsolateral frontal cortex
      (p\_<\_.05, FWE-corrected).ConclusionsDivergent patterns between current MJ
      use and elements of cortical architecture were associated with early MJ use
      onset. Considering brain development in early adolescence, findings are consistent
      with disruptions in pruning. However, divergence with continued use for many
      years thereafter suggests altered trajectories of brain maturation during late
      adolescence and beyond.Keywords: Adolescence, Marijuana, Cortical thickness,

      high school seniors reporting recent use and 6.5% of 12th graders being daily
      users (Johnston et al., 2014), marijuana (MJ) is the most frequently used illicit
      substance among adolescents. Across all age groups over 70% of new drug initiates
      start with using MJ at an average age of 18 years (SAMHSA, 2014). Indeed, the
      scope of MJ use prevalence is of great public interest, as MJ use in early adolescence
      is associated with increased risk of greater substance use, legal problems,
      disrupting education, injuries/medical problems, developing psychopathology,
      cognitive changes and chronic psychosocial struggles (CASA, 2011, Fergusson
      and Horwood, 1997, Fergusson et al., 1996, Patton et al., 2002). Taken together,
      rates of MJ use are suggestive of an epidemic based in adolescence, which is
      concerning not just due to societal cost, but also due to the potential to offset
      sensitive brain development during this period.Despite its prevalence, the impact
      of MJ use on adolescent brain development is not fully known. Important neuromaturational
      processes during adolescence through young adulthood are believed to bring about
      improved higher-order cognition by refining neural systems locally and globally
      through white and gray matter development (Casey et al., 2005, Giedd, 2008,
      Paus, 2005). In general, gray matter reductions and cortical thinning coincide
      with increased white matter volume and organization through adolescence and
      young adulthood, suggestive of synaptic pruning and axonal myelination (Giorgio
      et al., 2010, Gogtay et al., 2004, Hasan et al., 2007, Lebel et al., 2010, Shaw
      et al., 2008). The endogenous cannabinoid (CB) system is also immature during
      adolescence (Anavi-Goffer and Mulder, 2009, Verdurand et al., 2011). In an animal
      model (Verdurand et al., 2011) imaged CB1 receptor binding using PET and found
      relatively lower activation of CB1 receptors in adolescent rats compared to
      adult rats in brain areas including those in the frontal cortex, temporal lobe
      (hippocampus and amygdala) and sub-cortical regions including striatal regions,
      thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus. Thus, adolescence represents a
      developmental period with vulnerability to structural and functional changes
      due to exogenous MJ exposure.Adolescent MJ use has the potential to cause structural
      and functional changes in the brain by altering cannabinoid signaling. One possible
      mechanism would be blunt neurotoxic influence. For example, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol
      (THC), the primary psychoactive component in MJ that binds CB1 receptors, is
      reported to cause cell shrinkage and damage DNA strands in THC-treated neuron
      cultures (Chan et al., 1998). This may be the mechanism by which smaller volumes
      have been observed in individuals exposed to cannabis during adolescence (Battistella
      et al., 2014). However, it is more likely that MJ exerts its influence on brain
      development indirectly. The cannabinoid system plays a role in modulating other
      neurotransmitters, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and monoamines
      (Lopez-Moreno et al., 2008). Specifically, activation of CB1 receptors is associated
      with down-regulating inhibitory GABAergic transmission in cortical interneurons
      during adolescence (Caballero and Tseng, 2012, Cass et al., 2014). In addition,
      CB signaling inhibits microglia function (Walter et al., 2003). These two points
      are important because cortical pruning processes involve glial-mediated synaptic
      elimination and altering the excitatory/inhibitory balance is liable to disrupt
      the selective tagging and preserving synapses (Selemon, 2013). The impact of
      this indirect influence on the developing brain may be in the observations of
      abnormal connectivity in those who began MJ use in adolescence (Jacobus et al.,
      2009). Evidence from human neuroimaging studies lends greater support to MJ-related
      disruptions to brain development.Structural neuroimaging studies have indicated
      that volumes of several brain areas are smaller in heavy adult MJ users especially
      in areas enriched with cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors, such as medial temporal
      lobe, and prefrontal cortex (Lorenzetti et al., 2010). Studies of adult chronic
      MJ users note brain volume reductions in temporal lobe, insula, and prefrontal
      cortex, amygdala and hippocampus (Battistella et al., 2014, Cousijn et al.,
      2012, Filbey et al., 2014, Matochik et al., 2005, Yucel et al., 2008). Among
      different characteristics of MJ involvement (e.g., dependence symptoms, use
      frequency, consumption), the age of initial MJ use is a robust factor that has
      been associated with smaller brain volumes in users. For example, Battistella
      et al. (2014) observed left parahippocampal gyrus and right temporal pole structural
      differences in 25 regular MJ users compared to 22 occasional users, however,
      even the occasional users who began smoking MJ during adolescence (before age
      18) demonstrated similar brain changes as the regular users. Our group has also
      found links with early MJ use onset (Bava et al., 2009) and structural connectivity
      with orbitofrontal cortex in a cohort of daily MJ users, suggesting complex
      neuroadaptive processes related to MJ use in the context of adolescent brain
      development (Filbey et al., 2014). These findings underscore the potential for
      significant heterogeneity in brain changes among adult MJ users, especially
      those who began using MJ during neurodevelopment.Studies comparing early adolescent
      MJ use to users initiating MJ use in later adolescence provide further evidence
      for the potential of MJ to cause enduring change. The few studies that have
      directly investigated the timing of the effects of MJ during adolescence have
      noted divergent neurodevelopment effects. For example, in an fMRI study by Gruber
      and colleagues, functional and behavioral differences during an interference
      task were reported between early (before age 16) and late (after age 16) MJ
      users (Gruber et al., 2012) (Sagar et al., 2015). The same group also reported
      decreased white matter integrity in early onset vs. late onset MJ users (mean
      age 14.46 vs. 17.93) (Gruber et al., 2014). Similar differential effects have
      also been noted in parietal lobe activation between early and late adolescent
      binge drinkers during a spatial working memory task (Tapert et al., 2004). These
      studies highlight the importance of clarifying the differential neural effects
      of early- and late-adolescent onset use.To that end, in the current study, we
      compared daily MJ users who were early onset users (<16 years old) versus late
      onset users (\u226516 years old) on measures of cortical morphology that are
      sensitive to developmental changes. We aimed to characterize both the effect
      of early onset status on cortical morphology as well as assess for morphological
      patterns linked to the continued use of MJ after early and late adolescent MJ
      initiation. We expected early onset users to show a morphological pattern consistent
      with disruption of early adolescent brain development (e.g., increased cortical
      thickness, greater gray/white definition of the cortical ribbon via disruptions
      to adolescent pruning processes) that may be more consistent with indirect impact
      of MJ of brain development. While gray matter decline has been shown to be associated
      with marijuana use, particularly in areas rich in CB1 receptors, increased cortical
      thickness and greater gray/white definition in the cortical ribbon point to
      potential disruption in neurodevelopment (i.e. synaptic pruning) that may result
      from MJ use at key developmental stages (i.e. earlier as opposed to later in
      adolescent neuronal development). Such disruptions may extend to gyrification
      as well. While this process begins in utero, there is evidence that gyrification
      is ongoing into adolescence (Armstrong et al., 1995, Alem\xE1n-G\xF3mez et al.,
      2013, Klein et al., 2014) and may also display aberrant developmental patterns
      in the presence of MJ use.2.\u2003MethodsThis study was approved by the University
      of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
      (UTSW) Institutional Review Boards. All participants were recruited from the
      Dallas-Ft.Worth metro area via flyers and advertisements. Following informed
      consent, MJ users completed two sessions \u2013 a baseline appointment for collecting
      demographic, psychosocial and behavioral measures and a thorough substance use
      history. Three days later the participants returned for a neuroimaging appointment.
      Prior to their scanning session, participants were asked to be abstinent from
      MJ use for 72\_h, from alcohol for 24\_h, and from caffeine and cigarettes for
      the preceding 2\_h. These were confirmed by self-report (MJ, alcohol, caffeine
      and cigarettes), quantitative THC urinalysis (MJ), and by breath alcohol level
      of .000 (alcohol) at the start of their session.2.1. ParticipantsWe scanned
      45 regular heavy MJ users as part of the parent project. Inclusion criteria
      were: right-handedness, English as the primary language and no histories of
      psychosis, traumatic brain injury, and MRI contraindications (e.g., pregnancy,
      non-removal metallic implants, claustrophobia). One subject reported a history
      of anxiety and depression and one other reported a history of ADHD as a child.
      Additional exclusions for the current study included: Axis I diagnosis (via
      SCID) other than cannabis use disorder, unusable sMRI due to motion artifact
      or poor signal-to-noise ratio that precluded accurate tissue segmentation (n\_=\_1)
      and incomplete drug use histories (n\_=\_2). Of the 42 remaining cases, 22 were
      early onset users (onset of first use before age 16). Group categorization using
      onset of regular use as opposed to onset of first use maintained the same grouping
      (mean early onset of regular use\_=\_16.5, mean late onset of regular use\_=\_19.0).
      Regular use was defined as at least one time per week. To determine how age
      of onset of regular MJ use influenced our reported effects, we performed these
      analyses while covarying for age of onset of regular use (see Supplement). Table
      1 summarizes demographic and substance use information according to onset status.
      Table 2 summarizes the correlation between age and identified marijuana use
      variables. Only MJ years of use and current age showed a statistically significant
      correlation. Participants were recruited based on self-reported daily MJ use
      and a positive urinalysis for THC metabolites at their baseline visit. All of
      the participants were screened via urinalysis for other drugs of abuse and were
      excluded if drugs (other than MJ) were detected. Participants were required
      to have used MJ for a minimum of 5000 lifetime occasions and self-report daily
      use (without >24\_h abstinence) for the last 60 days.Table 1Sample characteristics.

      \ Image acquisition Scanning sessions took place at the Advanced Imaging Research
      Center at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center three days following
      their initial visit. Another verification of THC metabolites via urinalysis
      was also performed before the scan. MRI images were collected using a 3T Philips
      whole-body scanner equipped with Quasar gradient subsystem (40\_mT/m amplitude,
      a slew rate of 220\_mT/m/ms). High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical scans were
      collected using a MPRAGE sequence: TR/TE/TI\_=\_2100/3.70/1100\_ms; flip angle\_=\_12\xB0;
      field of view\_=\_256\_mm\_\xD7\_256\_mm; slab thickness\_=\_160\_mm (along
      left-right direction); voxel size\_=\_1\_mm\_\xD7\_1\_mm\_\xD7\_1\_mm, Total
      scan time\_=\_3\_m 57\_s.2.2.2.  Image processing MPRAGE anatomical scans were
      pre-processed for surface-based analyses using FreeSurfer v5.3 semi-automated
      pipeline (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). This semi-automated pipeline included
      spatial (Talairach) and signal intensity normalization of images, volumetric
      segmentation and subcortical labeling (Dale et al., 1999, Fischl et al., 2002).
      Outer gray matter and white matter boundaries were then identified and reconstructed
      into a mesh of over 150,000 tessellated vertices to allow point-to-point surface
      measures (Fischl et al., 1999). Next, gyral anatomy is aligned to a standard
      spherical template using surface convexity and curvature measures. Resulting
      surfaces were inspected, blind to MJ onset status, to identify and correct any
      errors made during cortical reconstruction. Modifications to the volumes were
      made as necessary to correct for tissue misclassifications according to FreeSurfer's
      wiki manual (Schmansky et al., 2010). In preparation for analysis, each morphological
      measure for each case was co-registered to a standard template (fsaverage).
      Anatomical labels in FreeSurfer (Desikan et al., 2006) were used for interpretation
      of results.2.3. Morphological measures2.3.1.  Cortical thickness The width of
      the cortical ribbon was measured as the distance between corresponding vertices
      of the white matter and gray matter surfaces at each vertex in the cortical
      mantel (Fischl and Dale, 2000).2.3.2.  Gray\u2013white matter ratio (GWR) To
      assess the quality of cortical ribbon definition, a tissue contrast between
      gray and white matter signal intensities was computed as a percent ratio (W\_\u2212\_G)/(.5*(W\_+\_G))
      (from pctsurfcon v1.11.2.1, inbuilt component of FreeSurfer pipeline v5.3, 2011).
      White matter signal intensities were measured at an absolute length of 1\_mm
      below the gray\u2013white border surface and gray matter signal was measured
      30% into the cortical ribbon (Salat et al., 2009).2.3.3.  Local gyrification
      index The cortical surface from FreeSurfer's main pipeline is further processed
      to create an outer surface that encapsulates the gyral and sulcal curvature
      for each hemisphere, which serves as a basis for calculating a local gyrification
      index (Schaer et al., 2012). LGI is measured as the amount of cortex within
      the sulcal folds beneath the outer surface compared to the amount of visible
      cortex that touches the outer surface. Cortical maps are generated from repeated
      iterations of delineating a 25\_mm radius sphere on the outer surface and its
      corresponding point on the cortical surface using a matching algorithm.2.4.
      Background and premorbid characteristics2.4.1.  Sample characteristics Age,
      gender, education level, ethnicity, along with other background information,
      was obtained using a standard demographics questionnaire. The two-subtest administration
      of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning)
      provided estimates of intellect (Wechsler, 1999).2.4.2.  Substance use The Substance
      Use Disorder modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)
      (First et al., 2002) were administered by a trained research assistant to assess
      for lifetime and current symptoms of abuse and dependence for alcohol, nicotine,
      MJ and other substances. The SCID interview also provided the onset of use information.
      A Time Line Follow-Back (TLFB) approach was used to quantify alcohol, nicotine,
      and MJ use patterns for 90 days prior to study participation (Sobell and Sobell,
      1992). Marijuana use in grams was obtained via self-report in response to probes
      aimed at quantifying their regular use.2.5. Statistical analysesStatistical
      analyses were conducted in SPSS 18.0 for behavioral and psychosocial measures
      whereas general linear model group comparisons on surfaced-based morphology
      measures were carried out FreeSurfer's built-in application QDEC (v1.5). Independent
      samples t-tests, Mann\u2013Whitney U-tests or chi-square tests, compared groups
      on background and demographic variables (see Table 1). Before statistical analysis
      was conducted, the dependent measures of cortical thickness, GWR and LGI were
      smoothed using a FWHM Gaussian filter with a width of either 10 or 15\_mm. Separate
      univariate general linear model (GLM) was then used to model cortical thickness,
      GWR and LGI with onset status of MJ use as a between groups factor. The dependent
      variables were thickness, gray\u2013white ratio or local gyrification index
      and the independent variables were either recent monthly MJ use in grams (MJ
      grams) or duration of MJ use (MJ years). Age and total drinks in the past 2
      months were treated as nuisance covariates in the model. Using MJ years of use
      and MJ grams as independent predictors of interest allowed us to characterize
      and differentiate the latent developmental effects from cumulative and current
      effects of MJ use. The variable \u201Cmarijuana years of use\u201D was based
      on the participants\u2019 response to the question \u201CFor how many years
      have you been using marijuana regularly?\u201D Of note, an outlier in the early
      onset group was removed before the statistical comparisons were performed.3.\u2003Results3.1.
      Cortical thicknessThere were no regions of group differences in cortical thickness
      by early onset status alone, controlled for age and alcohol use. However, MJ
      use characteristics were correlated with anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      thickness based on onset status. Early onset users showed increased thickness
      with increased MJ grams while late onset users showed thinner cortex with increased
      MJ grams (p\_<\_0.05 uncorrected) (Table 3). The same pattern emerged with more
      years of MJ use being associated with thicker region of the right medial temporal
      lobe in the early onset users and the reverse for the late onset users (p\_<\_0.05
      uncorrected) (Fig. 1).Table 3Clusters of significant age of onset\_\xD7\_marijuana

      1).3.3. GyrificationMJ use onset status alone showed no significant main effects
      above age and alcohol covariates. However, onset status was correlated with
      divergent patterns between local gyrification and MJ use, whereby early onset
      users showed decreasing LGI with increasing MJ consumption and longer duration
      of use in prefrontal cortex regions p\_<\_0.05, FWE corrected. The left hemisphere
      clusters encompassed the majority of the length of the middle lateral surface
      of the left cortex, including motor cortices, parietal lobe and multimodal integration
      areas (Fig. 1).4.\u2003DiscussionThe present study was designed to characterize
      the cortical architecture in adolescent onset MJ users by comparing early adolescent
      onset users to late adolescent onset in MJ use on measures of cortical thickness,
      gray/white matter contrast and gyrification. The primary finding was that early
      versus late onset MJ users showed a divergent pattern in cortical thickness,
      definition of the cortical ribbon and local gyrification with continued use
      through and beyond adolescent years. Specifically, early onset users showed
      cortical thickening, enhanced gray/white matter contrast, and decreased gyrification
      in association with more years of MJ use and current consumption of MJ in grams
      in frontal and temporal regions \u2013 areas that underlie higher order cognition
      including executive functioning, learning and memory. Findings were above and
      beyond effects of alcohol and current age, therefore, results are less likely
      to reflect morphological trends due to aging.Our findings did not find the expected
      age of onset differences previously reported in marijuana users (Gruber et al.,
      2012, Gruber et al., 2014). This inconsistency suggests that the age of onset
      effects may be more robust in brain white matter connectivity (Gruber et al.,
      2014) and function (Gruber et al., 2012) than brain surface morphometry. To
      date, the few studies that have described altered cortical morphology in MJ
      users have led to mixed findings. Mata et al. (2010) identified brain regions
      with decreased sulcal depth suggestive of lower gyrification in a study of adult
      MJ users. Jacobus and Tapert (2014) recently reported increased cortical thickness
      in the entorhinal cortex among 24 adolescent MJ users (mean age\_=\_17.7, mean
      MJ onset age\_=\_15.4) relative to peer controls. However, the authors also
      reported a negative relationship between cortical thickness and total MJ use
      in the right paracentral gyrus, and they observed consistent positive relationships
      in various brain regions between age of MJ onset and thickness. In the only
      other known adolescent study of cortical thickness and MJ, Lopez-Larson and
      colleagues studied 18 adolescent heavy MJ users (similar in age and MJ onset
      as Jacobus and Tapert, 2014) and reported mixed findings of increased thickness
      in prefrontal/insula regions and decreased thickness in posterior/temporal lobe
      areas in the MJ users compared to controls. In contrast to Jacobus and Tapert,
      2014, Lopez-Larson et al., 2011 found areas of the frontal lobe and insula that
      were thinner with increased urine THC metabolites and thicker with earlier age
      of onset. Select findings from the current study align with aspects of both
      of these studies, with a consensus supporting findings of a negative dose-dependent
      relationship between MJ use and cortical thickness. Given the low availability
      of studies to compare, this consensus is very limited. Although Jacobus et al.
      and Lopez-Larson et al. found the opposite effect of age of onset on thickness,
      the pattern of divergence among early vs. late onset users in the current study
      is more consistent with the latter study, whereby we saw early onset users exhibit
      thicker cortex with continued MJ use. Taken together, findings of increased
      thickness related to early MJ onset accompanied by negative dose-dependent relationships
      with MJ exposure may reflect two distinct processes. One process may be specific
      to the interactions with cortical development during early adolescence, likely
      leading to a disruption in pruning, and, the other, specific to the pharmacological
      effect with heavy chronic MJ use.In the only known study to examine the curvature-morphology
      of the cortex in adult MJ users, Mata et al. (2010) identified decreased sulcal
      concavity and thinner sulci in 23\_MJ users compared to controls (n\_=\_44),
      also in prefrontal areas. However, they did not observe significant relationships
      with age, MJ onset age, or cumulative MJ use. It is interesting that the authors
      detected group level differences (MJ vs. controls) but no correlations with
      MJ use characteristics such as dose or age of onset, whereas our primary findings
      are the consistent effects of continued MJ use differing after early or late
      adolescent onset. There are substantial methodological explanations for this
      disparity. For example, the current study did not compare morphology in MJ users
      to a normative control sample, therefore, it is feasible that group-level differences
      may emerge with such a comparison. Likewise, we deliberately covaried for current
      age in order to control for brain changes with aging and thus optimize our interrogation
      of developmental effects of early onset age and of aspects of continued use.The
      heterogeneity of MJ effects clearly suggests a multifactorial system of neurobiological
      processes involved. The primary results uphold that age of onset is a robust
      variable that differentiates heavy MJ users based on early versus late MJ onset.
      However, this group distinction relied on current use characteristics. Therefore,
      in the absence of group-level differences, the interactions between onset age
      and current use indicates that continued cannabis exposure and early adolescent
      developmental factors both contribute to a dynamic and sustained departure from
      what is expected based on developmental studies.Typical synaptic refinement
      processes during early adolescence are in the context of long-term depression
      and potentiation of cortical neurons in order to facilitate neuronal remodeling.
      Thus, the normal course of early adolescent development is uniquely vulnerable
      to disruption by MJ due to the electrochemical conditions and maturity of brain
      processes that would not present together again. Cass and colleagues tested
      the sensitivity of early adolescence cannabinoid exposure in an animal model
      (Cass et al., 2014). They found that acute administration of cannabinoid agonists
      in early, middle and late adolescent rats led to a state of frequency-dependent
      disinhibition of neurons in the frontal cortex in the early-to-middle adolescent
      rats, but not in the late adolescent rats. Moreover, the authors also noted
      that adult rats previously exposed to cannabinoid agonists in adolescence displayed
      comparable neuronal disinhibition. Thus, by changing the inhibitory/excitatory
      landscape during adolescence, MJ can influence lasting changes to typical cortical
      remodeling during sensitive early adolescent years.The sequence of pruning and
      myelination likely plays a formative role in lasting changes from early adolescent
      onset MJ use. With decreased synaptic elimination, our findings of greater GW
      border contrast may reflect greater proliferation of myelin at the boundary
      of the cortical ribbon where non-pruned synapses remained with linked axons.
      Findings of altered white matter tissue qualities are mixed in adolescent and
      adult MJ user samples. Some report both increases and decreases in fractional
      anisotropy (FA) and average water diffusion (Bava et al., 2009) whereas others
      report consistent decreases in FA among adolescent MJ users (Ashtari et al.,
      2009, Jacobus et al., 2009) or null findings (Delisi et al., 2006). Two studies
      of diffusion tensor imaging in adult MJ users reported reduced FA in users compared
      to controls (Gruber et al., 2011, Gruber et al., 2014). In addition to equivocal
      findings, research is needed to address the microstructural changes that could
      result in altered definition of the cortical ribbon. For example, rather than
      whole brain techniques that assess diffusion measures along major white matter
      tracts, indices assessing axonal organization along radial and interneuron association
      fibers along the cortical ribbon are needed. This scenario played out could
      result in increased gray matter (thicker cortex from disrupted pruning) and
      the myelination of connections to these spared terminals would result in increased
      density of white matter at the cortical boundary. Without any known studies
      of adolescent development of the gray/white tissue contrast at the cortical
      border to serve as a point of comparison, we speculate that early adolescent
      disruption of pruning and subsequent myelination of connections at the cortical
      boundary would be reflected by increased GWR as we saw in the current study.5.\u2003Limitations
      and conclusionsThe cross-sectional nature of this study limits causal attributions
      in terms of what we can infer to be directly related to the effects of MJ. Although
      a longitudinal design is optimal for addressing brain changes directly due to
      MJ, cross-sectional studies facilitate data-driven hypotheses that can be assessed
      directly in prospective studies.It is important to keep in mind that the participants
      were not explicitly asked for possible years of abstinence during their period
      of regular use, which may have created possible inflation in reported duration
      of regular use. However, because the participants provided number of years of
      \u201Cregular\u201D marijuana use, this inherently suggests continued, uninterrupted
      years of use. Concurrent nicotine use could have also influenced our reported
      results. But in the absence of a larger sample size and the presence of huge
      variance in nicotine use in the current sample, we were unable to verify the
      effect of nicotine use in the reported results.Interpretation of these findings
      is also limited by the lack of behavioral anchors for the observed morphological
      effects and lack of information on other aspects of developmental history that
      could further characterize the effects of marijuana during neurodevelopment.
      This is further limited by the absence of \u201Cexpected\u201D patterns based
      on normative data. Given the varied directions of effects and the small sample
      size, these findings should be replicated and be viewed as preliminary.To conclude,
      early MJ use was linked to altered neurodevelopmental patterns in brain regions
      sub-serving higher-order cognitive process. Clinical implications include need
      for early, targeted intervention. Given that the most robust results were related
      to interactions between onset age and continued use through emerging adulthood,
      harm reduction approaches may be effective in moderating adolescent MJ use to
      levels that are less likely to cause long-term developmental changes.Conflict

      the meaning of abstract mathematical symbols is a cornerstone of arithmetic
      learning in children. Studies have long focused on the role of spatial intuitions
      in the processing of numerals. However, it has been argued that such intuitions
      may also underlie symbols that convey fundamental arithmetic concepts, such
      as arithmetic operators. In the present cross-sectional study, we used fMRI
      to investigate how and when associations between arithmetic operators and brain
      regions processing spatial information emerge in children from 3rd to 10th grade.
      We found that the mere perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign elicited grade-related
      increases of spatial activity in the right hippocampus. That is, merely perceiving
      \u2018+\u2019 signs \u2013 without any operands \u2013 elicited enhanced hippocampal
      activity after around 7th grade (12\u201313 years old). In these children, hippocampal
      activity in response to a \u2018+\u2019 sign was further correlated with the
      degree to which calculation performance was facilitated by the preview of that
      sign before an addition problem, an effect termed operator-priming. Grade-related
      increases of hippocampal spatial activity were operation-specific because they
      were not observed with \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs, which might evoke rote retrieval
      rather than numerical manipulation. Our study raises the possibility that hippocampal
      spatial mechanisms help build associations between some arithmetic operators
      and space throughout age and/or education.Keywords: Arithmetic, Development,
      Attention, Space, fMRI, Hippocampus1.\u2003IntroductionHumans are unique in
      their ability to represent abstract mathematical concepts by culturally invented
      symbols, such as Arabic numerals and arithmetic signs. Because these symbols
      are arbitrary, learning the relationship between their identity and the concept
      they represent is a challenge during early math education in children. Most
      prior studies have focused on the mechanisms supporting the acquisition of symbols
      representing numerical quantities (Piazza et al., 2007, Ansari, 2008, Holloway
      and Ansari, 2009, Lyons and Ansari, 2009, Mundy and Gilmore, 2009). However,
      efficient processing of symbols that convey fundamental arithmetic concepts
      (i.e., operators) may be an important and largely neglected aspect of arithmetic
      skills. This is suggested by the operator-priming effect (Roussel et al., 2002,
      Fayol and Thevenot, 2012, Mathieu et al., 2017), whereby the anticipated presentation
      of a \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019 sign 150\_ms before a single-digit addition
      or subtraction problem facilitates problem-solving in adults.What aspect of
      the processing of an operator may cause the operator-priming effect in adults?
      A first possibility is that an arithmetic sign may automatically evoke a network
      of facts. For example, the perception of a \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019 sign
      might pre-activate a network of additive or subtractive facts that would have
      been built in declarative memory after years of practice (Campbell and Xue,
      2001, Ashcraft, 1992). Pre-activating such a network would facilitate the retrieval
      of the answer from memory when operands are presented. A second possibility
      is that an arithmetic sign may prime a specific procedure that would have been
      \u201Cautomatized\u201D after its repeated practice during arithmetic learning.
      For instance, Fayol and Thevenot argued that perceiving a \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019
      sign might trigger an automatized procedure that could be \u201Clinked to the
      convocation of the mental number line and could correspond to a preparation
      for a quick left-to-right or right-to-left browsing of this mental line\u201D
      (Fayol and Thevenot, 2012). This proposal echoes the idea that adding or subtracting
      numbers involves rightward and leftward shifts of attention from a source to
      a target number along a mental map of numbers oriented from left to right, i.e.,
      the mental number line (MNL) (Hubbard et al., 2005, Masson and Pesenti, 2014,
      Mathieu et al., 2016, Pinheiro-Chagas et al., 2017). Pre-activating such a procedure
      would result in a facilitation of subsequent calculation when operands are presented,
      thereby explaining the operator-priming effect.Interestingly, two lines of evidence
      favor the procedural over the declarative interpretation of the operator-priming
      effect. First, the effect is not observed with the \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign and
      multiplication problems (Roussel et al., 2002, Mathieu et al., 2017). Multiplication
      problems, however, are explicitly learned by rote in school and multiplication
      is unanimously viewed as the operation having the strongest association with
      a network of facts in memory (Campbell and Xue, 2001, Galfano et al., 2003,
      Thibodeau et al., 1996). Therefore, the lack of operator-priming effect for
      multiplication problems is difficult to reconcile with the idea that the effect
      is due to associations between operators and networks of stored facts. Second,
      in line with Fayol and Thevenot\u2019s proposal that \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\u2212\u2019
      signs may prime a spatial scanning of the MNL, a recent study suggests that
      \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\u2212\u2019 signs do evoke spatial intuitions. Specifically,
      Pinhas et al. (2014) found that, when instructed to categorize \u2018+\u2019
      and \u2018\u2212\u2019 signs with left-hand or right-hand responses, adults
      tend to respond faster to \u2018+\u2019 signs with the right hand than with
      the left hand, whereas they tend to respond faster to \u2018-\u2019 signs with
      the left hand than with the right hand (Pinhas et al., 2014). Thus, \u2018+\u2019
      and \u2018\u2212\u2019 signs appear to have some automatic associations with
      the right and left sides of space, respectively.Using fMRI, we recently found
      that such spatial associations may stem from the fact that some arithmetic operators
      are automatically processed in brain regions involved in spatial attention in
      adults. We showed that the mere perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign elicits greater
      activity than the mere perception of a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign in brain regions
      underlying overt spatial attention. These included the frontal eye fields (FEF)
      and the posterior superior parietal lobule (PSPL) (Mathieu et al., 2017). Thus,
      perceiving a \u2018+\u2019 sign (but not a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign) may be associated
      with a deployment of spatial attention in educated adults. Therefore, the rightward
      shifts of attention that have been posited to underlie addition problem-solving
      (Hubbard et al., 2005, Masson and Pesenti, 2014, Mathieu et al., 2016) might
      be primed by the mere preview of the addition sign (but not by the preview of
      a multiplication sign because multiplication is typically learned by rote and
      unlikely to be associated with movements along the MNL). Overall, there is mounting
      evidence that at least some arithmetic operators (e.g., \u2018+\u2019 but not
      \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs) evoke spatial intuitions in adults, and that these intuitions
      may relate to the operator-priming effect.However, associations between operators
      and space are arguably not innate. Therefore, a fundamental outstanding question
      is how and when such associations emerge in the developing brain. To answer
      that question, we studied 34 children from 3rd to 10th grade while they performed
      3 tasks. First, fMRI activity was measured while children were instructed to
      make eye saccades towards visually presented targets. This allowed us to precisely
      localize several regions of interest (ROIs) involved in spatial attention across
      children. Second, fMRI activity was measured in these spatial attention ROIs
      while children were presented with trials in which a \u2018+\u2019 sign was
      displayed without any operands (hereafter addition sign-only trials). As in
      our previous study in adults (Mathieu et al., accepted), activity during the
      perception of addition sign-only trials was compared to activity associated
      with trials in which a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign was displayed without any operands
      (hereafter multiplication sign-only trials) because these do not appear to evoke
      any specific intuitions in adults (Fayol and Thevenot 2012). This allowed us
      to identify the spatial attention ROIs in which activity in response to a \u2018+\u2019
      sign (as compared to a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign) increases with age and/or education,
      as well as the developmental time course of these effects.1 Third, outside of
      the scanner, we asked subjects to perform an operator-priming task and measured
      the correlation between inter-individual differences in the size of the operator-priming
      effect and inter-individual differences in sign-related activity in spatial
      attention ROIs as a function of grade. This allowed us to evaluate when sign-related
      activity in spatial attention ROIs leads to an operator-priming effect in children.2.\u2003Material
      and methods2.1. ParticipantsForty-two right-handed children from 3rd to 10th
      grade participated in the study. All were native French speakers. Participants
      did not have prior history of neurological disease, psychiatric disorders, learning
      disabilities or attention deficits. All children and parents provided written
      informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the local
      ethics committee (CPP Sud-Est-II). Families received 80\u20AC for their participation.
      Data from 8 subjects were excluded because of excessive head-movement in the
      scanner (see criteria in the Section 2.7., n\_=\_3), poor whole-brain coverage
      (i.e. susceptibility artefacts from dental braces, n\_=\_3) and unacceptably
      low performance during the task (i.e., lower than 50% accuracy on the sign-plus-operand
      trials, n\_=\_2). Therefore, the final sample consisted of 34 children (20 males)
      from 3rd to 10th grade (age range: 8\u201315, mean age\_=\_11.37, SD\_=\_1.84).
      For each child, a continuous measure of grade was calculated by taking into
      account the specific date within the grade year when that child was scanned.
      The whole sample (n\_=\_34) was evenly split into three groups as a function
      of grade: 11 children were from the \u2018lower grades\u2019 group (grade 3.2\u20135.4;
      mean\_=\_4.4), 11 children were from the \u2018intermediate grades\u2019 group
      (grade 5.6\u20136.9; mean\_=\_6.2), and 12 children were from the \u2018higher
      grades\u2019 group (grade 7.6\u201310.2; mean\_=\_8.5).2.2. Standardized measuresChildren
      were administered standardized tests of intellectual and arithmetic abilities
      to ensure that there were no age differences with respect to those measures.
      Full-scale IQ was measured using the NEMI-2 (Cognet, 2006). Basic arithmetic
      knowledge was evaluated with the Math-Fluency subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson-III
      Tests of Achievement (WJ-III) (Woodcock et al., 2001). Across all participants,
      standardized (i.e., age-normalized) scores on IQ (mean\_=\_112; SD\_=\_10) and
      Math Fluency (mean\_=\_106; SD\_=\_16) tests were within the normal range. One-way
      ANOVAs with the between-subject factor group (lower, intermediate, higher grades)
      revealed no main effect of group on IQ (F(2,31)\_=\_0.591, p\_=\_0.560, BF10\_=\_0.29),
      indicating that age-normalized intellectual abilities were similar across groups.
      However, there was a main effect of group on Math Fluency (F(2,31)\_=\_5.867,
      p\_=\_0.007, BF10\_=\_7.24): Children from intermediate grades had a higher
      age-normalized score (mean\_=\_118; SD\_=\_18) than children from lower (mean\_=\_100;
      SD\_=\_11) and higher grades (mean\_=\_100; SD\_=\_13). Therefore, we included
      standardized Math-Fluency scores as nuisance covariate in all of our analyses.2.3.
      Behavioral sessionAfter standardized testing, children participated in a behavioral
      session during which they performed an operator-priming task adapted from Fayol
      and Thevenot (2012) and Roussel et al. (2002). Children were asked to evaluate
      56 single-digit addition and 56 multiplication problems composed of operands
      between 2 and 9. Problems were presented in both commutative orders. Tie problems
      were excluded. Problems with a sum smaller than or equal to 11 and a product
      smaller or equal to 24 were considered small. Other problems were considered
      large.In each trial, a problem was presented with an answer (Fig. 1a). The arithmetic
      sign was presented either 150\_ms before (Negative SOA condition) or at the
      same time (Null SOA condition) as the operands (Fig. 1a). All problems were
      presented once in both SOA condition with a valid answer. Twenty-eight addition
      and 28 multiplication problems were also presented in both SOA condition with
      an invalid answer (obtained by adding or subtracting 1 to or from the valid
      answer). Trials were pseudorandomly ordered so that no more than three problems
      of the same type appeared consecutively. Problems with an invalid answer were
      randomly chosen across subjects and the order of blocks was counter-balanced
      between subjects. The experiment started with 8 practice trials.Open in a separate
      windowFig. 1Experimental design. (a) During the behavioral session, children
      (n\_=\_34) were asked to evaluate the result of single-digit addition and multiplication
      problems. For both operations, the arithmetic sign was presented either 150\_ms
      before (negative SOA trials), or at the same time as the operands (null SOA
      trials). (b) In the scanner, children (n\_=\_34) performed an arithmetic task
      during which they were presented with sign-only (left) and sign-plus-operands
      (right) addition, multiplication and baseline trials. In each trial, a sign
      (\u2018+\u2019, \u2018\xD7\u2019 or \u2018\u25CA\u2019) was presented at the
      center of the screen for 150\_ms. In sign-only trials, the trial ended with
      the presentation of the sign and was simply followed by the inter-trial period
      of fixation. In sign-plus-operands trials (filler trials), the \u2018+\u2019
      or \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign was immediately followed by a single-digit addition
      or multiplication problem (respectively) presented along an answer and the \u2018\u25CA\u2019
      sign was followed by 3 letters. In those cases, children had 5000\_ms to evaluate
      whether the answer of the problem was true or false or to indicate whether one
      of the 3 letters was a B.The experiment was controlled by Presentation software
      (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA). Problems were displayed in white Arial
      60-point font on a black background. All trials started with the presentation
      of a white central fixation dot for 1500\_ms, immediately followed by a red
      central fixation dot for 1000\_ms signaling that the problem was about to be
      presented, either in the negative SOA condition or in the null SOA condition
      (Fig. 1a). Subjects had a maximum of 5000\_ms to evaluate whether the response
      was valid or invalid as quickly as possible by pressing one of two keys on the
      computer keyboard.2.4. fMRI sessionDuring fMRI scanning, children performed
      a spatial attention localizer task and an arithmetic task. The spatial attention
      localizer task consisted in alternating blocks of fixation and saccades. During
      saccade blocks (n\_=\_9), participants were asked to make saccades towards several
      successive target dots. Each saccade block contained 16 target dots (0.2\xB0
      visual angle) that appeared at random positions with an eccentricity of 3\xB0,
      3.5\xB0, 4\xB0, 4.5\xB0, 5\xB0 or 5.5\xB0 in the left or right visual field
      for an average of 800\_ms (with a jitter of \xB1200\_ms). During fixation blocks
      (n\_=\_9), participants were asked to maintain fixation on a central dot for
      12,800\_ms. Block order was counterbalanced across children.During the arithmetic
      task, children were presented with sign-only and sign-plus-operands versions
      of addition and multiplication trials (Fig. 1b). Each trial started with the
      presentation of either a \u2018+\u2019 or a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign at the center
      of the screen for 150\_ms. In sign-only trials (n\_=\_30), the trial ended with
      the presentation of the sign and was simply followed by the inter-trial period
      of fixation (see below). These sign-only trials were our trials of interest
      and allowed us to isolate neural activity due to the presentation of a sign
      alone. We also included in the experiment sign-plus-operands trials (n\_=\_50).
      In those filler trials, the \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign was immediately
      followed by a single-digit addition or multiplication problem (respectively)
      presented with an answer. Participants were asked to indicate whether the answer
      was true or false. The goal of these filler trials (for which associated activity
      would be difficult to interpret because any effects could be attributable to
      the anticipatory presentation of the operator, the appearance of the operands,
      or a combination of both of these factors) was only to keep children engaged
      and attentive in the scanner. They also induced an arithmetic context, thereby
      ensuring that the \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs presented in sign-only
      trials were perceived as arithmetic signs. Problems in sign-plus-operand trials
      were constructed following the same criteria as in the behavioral session. Finally,
      the baseline consisted in trials in which the arithmetic sign was replaced by
      an abstract non-arithmetic sign (i.e., \u2018\u25CA\u2019). We included 30 baseline
      sign-only trials (in which the \u2018\u25CA\u2019 sign was presented in isolation)
      and 50 baseline sign-plus-operand trials (in which the \u2018\u25CA\u2019 sign
      was followed by 3 letters and participants had to indicate whether one of these
      letters was a B). All trials were followed by a variable period of visual fixation
      ranging from 3000\_ms to 3800\_ms. That period consisted in a central white
      fixation dot that turned red 1000\_ms before the onset of the next trial. The
      arithmetic task was decomposed in 4 functional runs. All trials were intermixed
      and the timing and order of trial presentation within each run was optimized
      for estimation efficiency using optseq2 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/optseq/).
      Behavioral responses were recorded using an MR-compatible response device.Stimuli
      were generated using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany,
      CA). Prior scanning, children were familiarized with the fMRI environment during
      a practice session that took place after the standardized testing and the behavioral
      session. During this practice session, children learned to minimize head movement
      in a mock fMRI scanner. The actual scanning session took place no more than
      3 weeks after the practice session.2.5. Behavioral analysesRT data associated
      with the operator-priming task were normalized using a logarithmic transformation
      prior all analyses to improve the conformity of the data to the standard assumptions
      of parametric testing. Following Fayol and Thevenot (2012), mean RT was analyzed
      using planned comparisons that followed from a within-subject ANOVA with the
      factors Operation (Addition/Multiplication) and SOA (Negative/Null), conducted
      separately for each group. We report for all effects the corresponding Bayes
      factors (BF10), indicating the strength of evidence for the alternative hypothesis
      (H1) relative to the null hypothesis (H0). Substantial evidence in favor of
      the alternative hypothesis is typically suggested by a BF10 greater than 3 (Jeffreys,
      1961, Dienes, 2011).2.6. fMRI data acquisitionImages were collected with a Siemens
      Prisma 3T MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) at the CERMEP
      Imagerie du vivant in Lyon, France. The BOLD signal was measured with a susceptibility
      weighted single-shot EPI sequence. Imaging parameters were as follows: TR\_=\_2000\_ms,
      TE\_=\_24\_ms, flip angle\_=\_80\xB0, matrix size\_=\_128\_\xD7\_120, field
      of view\_=\_220\_\xD7\_206\_mm, slice thickness\_=\_3\_mm (0.48\_mm gap), number
      of slices\_=\_32. A high-resolution T1-weighted whole-brain anatomical volume
      was also collected for each participant. Parameters were as follows: TR\_=\_3500\_ms,
      TE\_=\_2.24\_ms, flip angle\_=\_8\xB0, matrix size\_=\_256\_\xD7\_256, field
      of view\_=\_224\_\xD7\_224\_mm, slice thickness\_=\_0.9\_mm, number of slices\_=\_192.2.7.
      fMRI preprocessingData analysis was performed using SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).
      Functional images were corrected for slice acquisition delays and spatially
      realigned to the first image of the first run. Images were then spatially smoothed
      with a Gaussian filter equal to twice the voxel size. ArtRepair was used to
      help remove motion from the functional images prior to normalization (Mazaika
      et al., 2009). Volumes with rapid scan-to-scan movements of greater than 1.5\_mm
      were repaired by interpolation of the two nearest non-repaired scans. Each run
      with more than 5% of the total number of volumes replaced was removed from the
      analyses. A subject was excluded from further analysis if more than one run
      was removed. The number of volumes replaced did not differ between grade groups
      (F(2,31)\_=\_2.20; p\_=\_0.13). Finally, functional images were normalized into
      the standard MNI space (normalized voxel size, 2\_\xD7\_2\_\xD7\_3.5\_mm3).2.8.
      fMRI processingEvent-related statistical analysis was performed according to
      the general linear model (GLM). For the localizer task, brain activity associated
      with saccades and fixation blocks was modeled as epochs with onsets and offsets
      time-locked to the beginning and the end of each block. Each epoch was convolved
      with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the time series data
      from each run were high-pass filtered (1/128\_Hz). Finally, serial correlations
      were corrected using an autoregressive AR(1) model. Following our previous study
      using the same task in adults (Mathieu et al., 2017), brain activity associated
      with sign-only trials during the arithmetic task was estimated using a finite
      impulse response (FIR) model. We modeled 8 time points with an interval of 2\_s
      (corresponding to one TR) ranging from the onset of the sign to 16\_s after
      the sign. The magnitude of the fMRI response for each type of sign-only trial
      was calculated by subtracting activity at the onset of the sign (i.e., 1st bin,
      or 0\_s after the onset) from the peak activity (i.e., 4th bin, or \u223C8\_s
      after the onset). The time series data from each run were high-pass filtered
      (1/128\_Hz), and serial correlations were corrected using an autoregressive
      AR(1) model.2.9. Region of interest (ROI) definition and analysesThe present
      study used a Region-of-Interest (ROI) approach to analyze brain activity associated
      with sign-only trials in brain regions involved in the orienting of spatial
      attention in children. All ROIs were independently defined using the contrast
      of saccades versus fixation blocks in the spatial attention localizer task.
      All subject-specific contrasts were entered into a random effect (RFX) one-sample
      t-test across subjects. The RFX contrast map was then thresholded across the
      whole-brain using an uncorrected voxel-level threshold of p\_<\_0.001 and a
      false-discovery-rate (FDR) corrected cluster-level threshold of p\_<\_0.05 (Chumbley
      and Friston 2009). Using the SPM toolbox Marsbar (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/),
      ROIs were defined as 6-mm radius spheres around the peak coordinate of each
      region.Within each ROI and for each participant, we calculated the average response
      (parameter estimates) for \u2018+\u2019 signs using the contrast of addition
      sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials. Similarly, we calculated
      the average response for \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs using the contrast of multiplication
      sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials. Two analyses were performed
      in each ROI. First, we identified the ROI(s) in which a difference in fMRI activity
      between \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs emerged throughout age and/or
      education, using a 3\_\xD7\_2 ANOVA with the between-subject factor group (lower/intermediate/higher
      grades) and the within-subject factor sign (\u2018+\u2019/\u2018\xD7\u2019).
      Second, we tested in these ROIs whether inter-individual differences in the
      fMRI response to an arithmetic sign were correlated with inter-individual differences
      in the size of the operator-priming effect (measured in the behavioral session)
      for each group. In all analyses, we report uncorrected P values as well as P
      values corrected for multiple comparisons across all identified ROIs using the
      Bonferroni procedure. Bayes factor are also reported.3.\u2003Results3.1. The
      spatial localizer task activates a brain network encompassing frontal, parietal,
      occipital and hippocampal regionsContrasting saccades to fixation blocks in
      the spatial attention localizer task, we first identified 10 clusters supporting
      the orienting of spatial attention across subjects: the bilateral Frontal Eye
      Field (FEF), bilateral Posterior Superior Parietal Lobule (PSPL), bilateral
      Middle Temporal Gyri (MTG), bilateral Middle Occipital Gyri (MOG), right dorsal
      Inferior Frontal Gyrus (dIFG), and right Hippocampus (see Table 1 and Fig. 2).
      Therefore, a large brain network was involved in the orienting of spatial attention
      across subjects. Each of these regions served as an ROI in subsequent analyses.Table

      The right hippocampus region identified by the spatial localizer task is increasingly
      activated in response to a \u2018+\u2019 sign but not to a \u2018\xD7\u2019
      sign throughout age and/or educationA 3\_\xD7\_2 ANOVA with the between-subject
      factor group (lower/intermediate/higher grades) and the within-subject factor
      sign (\u2018+\u2019/\u2018\xD7\u2019) was then conducted in each of the 10 ROIs
      identified by the spatial attention localizer. We found an interaction between
      group and sign in the right hippocampus (F(2.30)\_=\_6.75, p\_=\_0.0038, pcorr\_=\_0.038;
      Fig. 3a and b), but not in any other ROIs (all Fs\_<\_3.44, all ps\_>\_0.046,
      all pscorr\_>\_0.46). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for
      this interaction in the right hippocampus (BF10\_=\_11.53), while no or anecdotal
      evidence for such an interaction was found in the other ROIs (BF10\_<\_1.63).
      Follow-up t-tests in the hippocampus ROI revealed that children from higher
      grades (average grade\_=\_8.5) exhibited greater activity for addition than
      multiplication sign-only trials (t11\_=\_3.02, p\_=\_0.012), whereas there was
      no difference between signs in children from intermediate grades (average grade\_=\_6.2)
      (t10\_=\_0.87, p\_=\_0.41) and even a trend for less activity for addition than
      multiplication sign-only trials in children from lower grades (average grade\_=\_4.4)
      (t10\_=\_2.22, p\_=\_0.051). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence
      for a difference of activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials
      in children from higher grades (BF10\_=\_5.21), but evidence for this difference
      was absent in intermediate grades (BF10\_=\_0.41) and anecdotal in lower grades
      (BF10\_=\_1.69). Finally, across all groups, addition sign-only trials were
      associated with greater activity than baseline sign-only trials in children
      from higher grades (t11\_=\_2.63, p\_=\_0.023), but not in any other groups
      (all ts\_<\_1.32, all ps\_>\_0.21). Multiplication sign-only trials were associated
      with greater activity than baseline sign-only trials in none of the groups (all
      ts\_<\_1.38, all ps\_>\_0.20). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence
      for a difference between addition sign-only trials and baseline sign-only trials
      in children from higher grades (BF10\_=\_3.00), but no or anecdotal evidence
      in the other groups (all BF10s\_<\_0.60) and for multiplication sign-only trials
      (all BF10s\_<\_0.63). Overall, then, a difference in fMRI response to a \u2018+\u2019
      and a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign emerged throughout age and/or education in the right
      hippocampus.Open in a separate windowFig. 3Grade-related changes of activity

      Difference in activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials
      over grade in the right Hippocampus. *p\_<\_0.05; r represents the Pearson correlation
      coefficient.The findings above were confirmed by an additional correlation analysis
      in which grade was treated as a continuous predictor across all subjects. The
      difference in activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials
      was positively correlated with grade in the right hippocampus (r\_=\_0.53, p\_=\_0.001,
      pcorr\_=\_0.01; Fig. 3c). No other significant grade-related changes were found
      in any other regions (all rs\_<\_0.38, all ps\_>\_0.03, all pscorr\_>\_0.30).
      Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for this correlation in
      the right hippocampus (BF10\_=\_20.97), but no or anecdotal evidence in any
      other ROIs (all BF10s\_<\_2.03). In the right hippocampus, the correlation between
      grade and the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials, was also near significance (r\_=\_0.33, p\_=\_0.056; BF10\_=\_1.22).2
      The correlation between grade and the contrast of multiplication sign-only trials
      versus baseline sign-only trials, however, was not significant (r\_=\_\u22120.18,
      p\_=\_0.32; BF10\_=\_0.35).3.3. Spatial hippocampal activity in response to
      a \u2018+\u2019 sign relates to an addition-priming effect in children from
      higher gradesWe then tested whether the hippocampal response to a \u2018+\u2019
      sign observed in children from higher grades was related to the operator-priming
      effect. To this aim, each child performed a version of the operator-priming
      task outside of the scanner (see Fig. 1a).First, we tested whether the results
      obtained by Fayol and Thevenot (2012) in adults (i.e., an operator-priming effect
      for addition but not for multiplication across subjects) could be extended to
      our children participants. Because children from lower grades had a performance
      close to chance on large problems (58%), we exclusively focused our analyses
      on small problems for which accuracy was significantly above chance in all groups
      (lower grades: 80%, intermediate grades: 92%, higher grades: 96%). Planned comparisons
      revealed an operator-priming effect for addition in children from higher grades
      (1491\_ms versus 1577\_ms; F(1,11)\_=\_8.11, p\_=\_0.016), but not in children
      from lower grades (2289\_ms versus 2417\_ms; F(1,10)\_=\_2.66, p\_=\_0.134)
      and intermediate grades (1530 versus 1509\_ms; F(1,10)\_=\_0.01, p\_=\_0.941).
      No operator-priming effect for multiplication was observed in any groups (lower
      grades: F(1,10)\_=\_3.50, p\_=\_0.091; intermediate grades: F(1,10)\_=\_1.52,
      p\_=\_0.246; higher grades: F(1,11)\_=\_0.14, p\_=\_0.715). Bayes Factor analysis
      indicated substantial evidence for an operator-priming effect with addition
      problems in children from higher grades (BF10\_=\_4.08), but no evidence in
      children from intermediate (BF10\_=\_0.30) and lower (BF10\_=\_0.83) grades.
      There was also no or anecdotal evidence for an operator-priming effect with
      multiplication problems in any group (higher grades: BF10\_=\_0.31; intermediate
      grades: BF10\_=\_0.55; lower grades: BF10\_=\_1.09).Second, we tested whether
      the size of the operator-priming effect in children (measured on small problems)
      was correlated to the magnitude of the response for addition sign-only trials
      versus baseline sign-only trials in the right hippocampus. Such a correlation
      was found to be highly significant in children from higher grades (r\_=\_0.82,
      p\_=\_0.0012, Fig. 4), surviving Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
      between the two conditions and across the three groups (pcorr\_=\_0.007). That
      is, children from higher grades who show greater responses to \u2018+\u2019
      signs in the right hippocampus are those who show larger operator-priming effect
      with addition problems. No significant correlation was found in children from
      lower (r\_=\_0.15, p\_=\_0.66 Fig. 4) and intermediate (r\_=\_0.24, p\_=\_0.48,
      Fig. 4) grades. Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for the
      correlation in children from higher grades (BF10\_=\_38.15), but no evidence
      in children from lower (BF10\_=\_0.40) and intermediate (BF10\_=\_0.46) grades.
      There was also no significant (and anecdotal evidence for a) correlation between
      the operator-priming effect for addition problems and the fMRI response to multiplication
      sign-only trials (compared to baseline sign-only trials) in the right hippocampus,
      in any of the groups (lower grades: r\_=\_0.06, p\_=\_0.87, BF10\_=\_0.37; intermediate
      grades: r\_=\_0.32, p\_=\_0.34, BF10\_=\_0.56; higher grades: r\_=\_0.51, p\_=\_0.09,
      BF10\_=\_1.28). Therefore, not only did we observe an operator-priming effect
      for addition in the only group in which we also observed a greater hippocampal
      response to \u2018+\u2019 than \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs (i.e., children from higher
      grades), but inter-individual differences in the size of the operator-priming
      effect in that group was also related to hippocampal activity.Open in a separate
      windowFig. 4Hippocampus brain-behavior correlation over grade.Activity in the
      right hippocampus in response to addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials as a function of the operator-priming effect calculated in the behavioral
      session for addition problems in children from lower (n\_=\_11; grade 3.2\u20135.4;
      mean grade\_=\_4.4; mean age\_=\_9.4), intermediate (n\_=\_11; grade 5.6\u20136.9;
      mean grade\_=\_6.2; mean age\_=\_11.1) and higher grades (n\_=\_12; grade 7.6\u201310.2;
      mean grade\_=\_8.5; mean age\_=\_13.4). r represents the Pearson correlation
      coefficient.Third, we tested whether the correlation between the operator-priming
      effect and the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials increased over grade. This was done by transforming the correlation coefficient
      in each group to a Fischer\u2019s z score before comparing the groups using
      the cocor package (Diedenhofen and Musch, 2015). Although the correlation was
      not greater in children from intermediate than lower grades (z\_=\_0.19, p\_=\_0.43,
      one-tailed), it was significantly greater in children from higher than lower
      grades (z\_=\_2.07, p\_=\_0.019, one-tailed) and in children from higher than
      intermediate grades (z\_=\_1.88, p\_=\_0.030, one-tailed). Therefore, this brain-behavior
      correlation increased over grade.4.\u2003DiscussionIn the present study, we
      used fMRI and a cross-sectional design to investigate (i) how and when spatial
      processing related to the perception of an addition sign emerges in the developing
      brain, and (ii) to what extent it contributes to the emergence of an operator-priming
      effect.4.1. The mere perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign is associated with increased
      hippocampal spatial activity throughout age and/or educationIt has been shown
      that the processing of a \u2018+\u2019 sign is associated with the right side
      of space (Pinhas et al., 2014) and activates brain regions involved in overt
      spatial attention in adults (Mathieu et al., 2017). Therefore, we expected arithmetic
      learning to be associated with increased recruitment of brain regions involved
      in spatial attention in response to the perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign throughout
      age and/or education in children. This was the case in a region of the right
      hippocampus that we identified in our spatial attention localizer task. Therefore,
      it is possible that hippocampal spatial mechanisms may scaffold the progressive
      association between an arithmetic operator (i.e., a \u2018+\u2019 sign) and
      spatial intuitions throughout age and/or education. There is increasing evidence
      that the hippocampal formation, and particularly the right hippocampus, may
      house a \u2018sense of space\u2019 (Buffalo, 2015). Specifically, the right
      hippocampus has been extensively reported to support spatial representation
      and navigation in humans (Maguire et al., 1998, Burgess et al., 2002) as well
      as in non-human primates and rodents (O'keefe and Nadel, 1978, Bird and Burgess,
      2008). For example, the hippocampus is typically activated when human participants
      learn to navigate through a mental representation of space (i.e., mental scanning)
      (Mellet et al., 2002, Spiers and Maguire, 2006). Interestingly, a recent study
      in monkeys demonstrated that neurons in the hippocampal formation may encode
      the direction of overt (Killian et al., 2015) as well as covert (Wilming et
      al., 2015) shifts of attention. Therefore, the hippocampal formation is likely
      a critical region for both representing a mental map of space and navigating
      along that map (Killian et al., 2012, Meister and Buffalo, 2016).Why would such
      a hippocampal spatial navigation mechanism be increasingly recruited by the
      mere perception of a\u2019+\u2019 sign throughout age and/or education? One
      possibility is that this mechanism might enable children to construct a detailed
      representation of numbers in mental space, as well as to navigate along that
      mental representation. Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence that numbers of
      increasing size are organized along a left-to-right mental map (i.e., the MNL)
      in adults (Fischer and Shaki 2014). This spatial representation may enable individuals
      to add or subtract numbers by navigating from a source to a target number to
      the left or right of that MNL. This is supported by behavioral studies showing
      that addition and subtraction problem-solving is associated with rightward and
      leftward shifts of attention (Masson and Pesenti, 2014, Mathieu et al., 2016),
      as well as by a neuroimaging study indicating an overlap between the brain regions
      involved in overt shifts of attention and those involved in arithmetic calculation
      in adults (Knops et al., 2009). Such strategies may be acquired early by children,
      sometimes even explicitly in the classroom where addition and subtraction is
      often demonstrated on visual number lines. Yet, it is only with practice that
      they might become progressively attached to and evoked by an arithmetic operator
      such as a \u2018+\u2019, which might explain the grade-related increases of
      activity in this region in response to the \u2018+\u2019 sign (and the fact
      that it is only by 7th grade that children exhibit significant activity in response
      to that sign).4.2. Hippocampal spatial activity in response to a \u2018+\u2019
      sign relates to the operator-priming effect in children from higher gradesA
      critical question is to what extent this automatic processing of a \u2018+\u2019
      sign in hippocampal spatial mechanisms is associated with children\u2019s behavior.
      To answer this question, we asked all children to perform a version of the operator-priming
      task developed by Fayol and Thevenot (2012) and Roussel et al. (2002). First,
      we replicated the operator-priming effect observed in adults with addition problems
      (i.e., a facilitation of problem-solving when the operator is presented 150\_ms
      before the operands), but only in children from higher grades (after around
      7th grade). Like in adults, this effect was specific to addition problems and
      not observed with multiplication problems. Thus, the perception of a \u2018+\u2019
      sign (but not that of a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign) appears to pre-activate a process
      that is likely used to solve the subsequent problem in children from higher
      grades. More central to our current interest, we found that the size of the
      operator-priming effect in these children was highly correlated with the degree
      of activation of hippocampal spatial mechanisms in response to a \u2018+\u2019
      sign. This indicates that hippocampal spatial activity may be at the source
      of the operator priming-effect in older children, perhaps because these children
      might prepare for an attentional movement along the MNL as soon as a \u2018+\u2019
      sign is presented. Because no brain-behavior correlation was observed in younger
      children, extensive practice might be needed before such mechanisms are triggered
      by the mere perception of the sign.4.3. Hippocampal spatial activity in response
      to a \u2018+\u2019 sign is transient in developmentStrikingly, the spatial brain
      mechanisms that respond to the mere perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign appear
      to be different in children and adults. That is, albeit we found increased hippocampal
      spatial activity throughout age and/or education in the present study, we did
      not identify these mechanisms in our previous study in adult participants using
      the exact same task (Mathieu et al., 2017). Rather, we found increased activity
      in response to a \u2018+\u2019 sign in neocortical regions of the FEF and PSPL
      in adults. Therefore, the contribution of the hippocampus to the automatic processing
      of a \u2018+\u2019 sign is likely transient. Such a transient involvement of
      the hippocampus is consistent with a wealth of studies that have demonstrated
      that the spatial representations initially supported by the hippocampus during
      learning become independent from this brain structure over experience and transferred
      to neocortical regions (Rosenbaum et al., 2004, Hirshhorn et al., 2012b). For
      example, longitudinal studies demonstrate that right hippocampal activity associated
      with learning to mentally navigate through a new environment disappears and
      is replaced by neocortical activity when individuals become familiar with that
      environment (Spiers and Maguire, 2007, Hirshhorn et al., 2012a). It is possible
      that the same phenomenon is at play here: The hippocampus may be involved in
      the early representation of (and navigation along) the MNL before that representation
      is transferred to neocortical regions of the fronto-parietal cortex. Future
      investigations with a wider age sample than in the present study are needed
      to test this hypothesis.4.4. Can right hippocampal involvement in the present
      study reflect mnemonic operations involved in learning arithmetic?Although there
      is no doubt that the hippocampus supports spatial processing (Burgess et al.,
      2002, Spiers and Maguire, 2007), this brain structure is also well known to
      support the encoding and consolidation of verbal declarative knowledge into
      long-term memory (Eichenbaum, 2004). In fact, previous developmental studies
      have largely explained the involvement of the hippocampus during arithmetic
      learning by referring to its role in declarative memory rather than spatial
      processing (Rivera et al., 2005, De Smedt et al., 2011, Cho et al., 2011, Cho
      et al., 2012, Qin et al., 2014). This interpretation relies on the claim that
      results of well-practiced arithmetic facts (e.g., 2\_+\_3 or 4\_\xD7\_2) might
      become progressively retrieved from memory (rather than calculated) over the
      course of learning and development (Campbell and Xue, 2001). The hippocampus
      might thus support the encoding and consolidation of networks of arithmetic
      facts in children.Can the role of the hippocampus in declarative memory explain
      the operator-specific activity over grade (and correlation with the operator-priming
      effect) observed in the region of the right hippocampus identified by our spatial
      localizer task? We acknowledge that we did not have a task identifying processes
      involved in declarative memory. Thus, even if the right hippocampus is usually
      more associated with spatial than mnemonic processes (Burgess et al., 2002),
      it is possible that the hippocampal cluster that we identified as being involved
      in spatial processing may also be involved in some aspects of declarative memory.
      One might thus argue that grade-related increases of activity in relation to
      \u2018+\u2019 signs reflect the progressive association between a \u2018+\u2019
      and a network of additive facts. This explanation, however, can be ruled out
      by an examination of activity related to \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs. Because single-digit
      multiplication problems are almost exclusively learned by rote in school, multiplication
      is the operation that is perhaps the most associated with a network of stored
      facts in the literature (Campbell and Xue, 2001). Thus, if increased hippocampal
      activity in relation to \u2018+\u2019 signs were due to the progressive building
      of a network of additive facts, increased activity in that same region should
      have been observed during the perception of \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs (perhaps
      even more so for the perception of \u2018+\u2019 signs). Yet, this is not the
      case. Not only did we not find any grade-related increase of activity for \u2018\xD7\u2019
      signs in the hippocampal cluster identified by our spatial localizer task, but
      activity was significantly greater for \u2018+\u2019 than \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs
      in higher graders (who are as proficient in single-digit multiplication as addition).
      Similarly, no operator-priming effect was observed for multiplication problems
      in higher graders, indicating that the operator-priming effect observed for
      addition is likely to have little to do with the pre-activation of a network
      of stored facts (because this should be also observed for multiplication). Therefore,
      the specificity of our results to \u2018+\u2019 signs (as compared to \u2018\xD7\u2019
      signs) in the right hippocampus ROI makes it very unlikely that our results
      are related to mnemonic operations. In our view, emerging associations between
      \u2018+\u2019 signs and spatial intuitions related to the MNL are the best explanation
      of the effects reported here.Of course, the fact that the role of the hippocampus
      in declarative memory is unlikely to explain our operator-specific findings
      in the right hippocampus ROI does not mean that hippocampal mechanisms supporting
      mnemonic operations do not contribute to arithmetic learning. Instead, they
      indicate that the hippocampus might contribute to arithmetic learning through
      its role in both declarative memory and spatial processing. Interestingly, the
      operator-specific activity observed in our (spatially localized) right hippocampal
      cluster is not observed in a mirror (left lateralized) cluster that is not activated
      in the localizer contrast (see Supplementary information). In that mirror region,
      no difference was observed between activity related to \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\xD7\u2019
      signs in any group of children (and left hippocampal activity was not related
      to the operator-priming effect). Thus, the developmental effect reported here
      appears to be restricted to the right hippocampus. This specificity suggests
      that the observed developmental changes in the right hippocampus may not simply
      reflect general brain maturation but rather mechanisms that are specific to
      arithmetic learning.4.5. LimitationsIt is worth acknowledging here 2 potential
      limitations of the present work. First, as is the case for any cross-sectional
      fMRI studies, our study is correlational in nature. Thus, although our findings
      are consistent with the idea that the right hippocampus might scaffold the progressive
      association between (at least some) arithmetic operators and space throughout
      age and/or education, future studies might specifically investigate the causal
      role of these hippocampal mechanisms. Second, our finding of a correlation between
      grade and the processing of an addition sign in the right hippocampus (see Fig.
      3C) relies on a relatively large sample size of 34 children. However, other
      findings involve subgroups of participants and therefore rely on smaller sample
      sizes. In particular, null findings in relation to these subgroups might be
      difficult to interpret because of potential lack of power. For example, whereas
      we found an operator-priming effect in children from higher grades and no effect
      in children from intermediate grades, there was no significant difference between
      these groups in terms of response times in negative SOA trials (1491\_ms versus
      1530\_ms; t21\_=\_0.21; p\_=\_0.84; BF10\_=\_0.39). Behavioral studies focusing
      on the operator-priming effect in children might test whether this difference
      emerges with larger sample sizes. More generally, future studies are needed
      to improve our understanding of the present results.5.\u2003ConclusionIn sum,
      our findings suggest that the right hippocampus might contribute to the progressive
      association between (at least some) arithmetic operators and space throughout
      age and/or education. Therefore, our study raises the possibility that increased
      hippocampal activity during arithmetic learning in children may be explained
      by the role of this structure in spatial representations as well as in declarative
      memory.Conflict of interestThe authors declare no competing financial interests.AcknowledgmentsThis

      that to induce an arithmetic context and disguise the goal of the experiment,
      we also included trials in which a \u2018\_+\_\u2019 or a \u2018\_\xD7\_\u2019
      sign was followed 150\_ms later by operands and participants were asked to solve
      the problem. The low temporal resolution of fMRI, however, makes it impossible
      to dissociate activity associated with the sign from activity associated with
      operands in these problems. Therefore, they were simply designed to be filler
      trials.2There was a tendency for a correlation between grade and activity associated
      with addition sign-only trials (versus fixation) in the right hippocampus (r\_=\_0.29,
      p\_=\_0.09; BF10\_=\_0.82), but no correlation for baseline sign-only trials
      (versus fixation) (r\_=\_\u22120.10, p\_=\_0.58; BF10\_=\_0.25). Thus, the correlation
      between grade and the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline
      sign-only trials was more likely driven by changes of activity in addition sign-only
      trials than in baseline sign-only trials.Appendix ASupplementary data associated
