      Introduction \n  \nWith more than 25% of high school seniors reporting recent
      use and 6.5% of 12th graders being daily users ( ), marijuana (MJ) is the most
      frequently used illicit substance among adolescents. Across all age groups over
      70% of new drug initiates start with using MJ at an average age of 18 years
      ( ). Indeed, the scope of MJ use prevalence is of great public interest, as
      MJ use in early adolescence is associated with increased risk of greater substance
      use, legal problems, disrupting education, injuries/medical problems, developing
      psychopathology, cognitive changes and chronic psychosocial struggles ( ,  ,  ,  ).
      Taken together, rates of MJ use are suggestive of an epidemic based in adolescence,
      which is concerning not just due to societal cost, but also due to the potential
      to offset sensitive brain development during this period. \n\nDespite its prevalence,
      the impact of MJ use on adolescent brain development is not fully known. Important
      neuromaturational processes during adolescence through young adulthood are believed
      to bring about improved higher-order cognition by refining neural systems locally
      and globally through white and gray matter development ( ,  ,  ). In general,
      gray matter reductions and cortical thinning coincide with increased white matter
      volume and organization through adolescence and young adulthood, suggestive
      of synaptic pruning and axonal myelination ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The endogenous cannabinoid
      (CB) system is also immature during adolescence ( ,  ). In an animal model (
      ) imaged CB1 receptor binding using PET and found relatively lower activation
      of CB1 receptors in adolescent rats compared to adult rats in brain areas including
      those in the frontal cortex, temporal lobe (hippocampus and amygdala) and sub-cortical
      regions including striatal regions, thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus.
      Thus, adolescence represents a developmental period with vulnerability to structural
      and functional changes due to exogenous MJ exposure. \n\nAdolescent MJ use has
      the potential to cause structural and functional changes in the brain by altering
      cannabinoid signaling. One possible mechanism would be blunt neurotoxic influence.
      For example, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component
      in MJ that binds CB1 receptors, is reported to cause cell shrinkage and damage
      DNA strands in THC-treated neuron cultures ( ). This may be the mechanism by
      which smaller volumes have been observed in individuals exposed to cannabis
      during adolescence ( ). However, it is more likely that MJ exerts its influence
      on brain development indirectly. The cannabinoid system plays a role in modulating
      other neurotransmitters, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate
      and monoamines ( ). Specifically, activation of CB1 receptors is associated
      with down-regulating inhibitory GABAergic transmission in cortical interneurons
      during adolescence ( ,  ). In addition, CB signaling inhibits microglia function
      ( ). These two points are important because cortical pruning processes involve
      glial-mediated synaptic elimination and altering the excitatory/inhibitory balance
      is liable to disrupt the selective tagging and preserving synapses ( ). The
      impact of this indirect influence on the developing brain may be in the observations
      of abnormal connectivity in those who began MJ use in adolescence ( ). Evidence
      from human neuroimaging studies lends greater support to MJ-related disruptions
      to brain development. \n\nStructural neuroimaging studies have indicated that
      volumes of several brain areas are smaller in heavy adult MJ users especially
      in areas enriched with cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors, such as medial temporal
      lobe, and prefrontal cortex ( ). Studies of adult chronic MJ users note brain
      volume reductions in temporal lobe, insula, and prefrontal cortex, amygdala
      and hippocampus ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Among different characteristics of MJ involvement
      (e.g., dependence symptoms, use frequency, consumption), the age of initial
      MJ use is a robust factor that has been associated with smaller brain volumes
      in users. For example,   observed left parahippocampal gyrus and right temporal
      pole structural differences in 25 regular MJ users compared to 22 occasional
      users, however, even the occasional users who began smoking MJ during adolescence
      (before age 18) demonstrated similar brain changes as the regular users. Our
      group has also found links with early MJ use onset ( ) and structural connectivity
      with orbitofrontal cortex in a cohort of daily MJ users, suggesting complex
      neuroadaptive processes related to MJ use in the context of adolescent brain
      development ( ). These findings underscore the potential for significant heterogeneity
      in brain changes among adult MJ users, especially those who began using MJ during
      neurodevelopment. \n\nStudies comparing early adolescent MJ use to users initiating
      MJ use in later adolescence provide further evidence for the potential of MJ
      to cause enduring change. The few studies that have directly investigated the
      timing of the effects of MJ during adolescence have noted divergent neurodevelopment
      effects. For example, in an fMRI study by Gruber and colleagues, functional
      and behavioral differences during an interference task were reported between
      early (before age 16) and late (after age 16) MJ users ( ) ( ). The same group
      also reported decreased white matter integrity in early onset vs. late onset
      MJ users (mean age 14.46 vs. 17.93) ( ). Similar differential effects have also
      been noted in parietal lobe activation between early and late adolescent binge
      drinkers during a spatial working memory task ( ). These studies highlight the
      importance of clarifying the differential neural effects of early- and late-adolescent
      onset use. \n\nTo that end, in the current study, we compared daily MJ users
      who were early onset users (<16 years old) versus late onset users (16 years
      old) on measures of cortical morphology that are sensitive to developmental
      changes. We aimed to characterize both the effect of early onset status on cortical
      morphology as well as assess for morphological patterns linked to the continued
      use of MJ after early and late adolescent MJ initiation. We expected early onset
      users to show a morphological pattern consistent with disruption of early adolescent
      brain development (e.g., increased cortical thickness, greater gray/white definition
      of the cortical ribbon via disruptions to adolescent pruning processes) that
      may be more consistent with indirect impact of MJ of brain development. While
      gray matter decline has been shown to be associated with marijuana use, particularly
      in areas rich in CB1 receptors, increased cortical thickness and greater gray/white
      definition in the cortical ribbon point to potential disruption in neurodevelopment
      (i.e. synaptic pruning) that may result from MJ use at key developmental stages
      (i.e. earlier as opposed to later in adolescent neuronal development). Such
      disruptions may extend to gyrification as well. While this process begins in
      utero, there is evidence that gyrification is ongoing into adolescence ( ,  ,  )
      and may also display aberrant developmental patterns in the presence of MJ use.
      \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis study was approved by the University of Texas at
      Dallas (UTD) and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) Institutional
      Review Boards. All participants were recruited from the Dallas-Ft.Worth metro
      area via flyers and advertisements. Following informed consent, MJ users completed
      two sessions  a baseline appointment for collecting demographic, psychosocial
      and behavioral measures and a thorough substance use history. Three days later
      the participants returned for a neuroimaging appointment. Prior to their scanning
      session, participants were asked to be abstinent from MJ use for 72h, from alcohol
      for 24h, and from caffeine and cigarettes for the preceding 2h. These were confirmed
      by self-report (MJ, alcohol, caffeine and cigarettes), quantitative THC urinalysis
      (MJ), and by breath alcohol level of .000 (alcohol) at the start of their session.
      \n\n### Participants \n  \nWe scanned 45 regular heavy MJ users as part of the
      parent project. Inclusion criteria were: right-handedness, English as the primary
      language and no histories of psychosis, traumatic brain injury, and MRI contraindications
      (e.g., pregnancy, non-removal metallic implants, claustrophobia). One subject
      reported a history of anxiety and depression and one other reported a history
      of ADHD as a child. Additional exclusions for the current study included: Axis
      I diagnosis (via SCID) other than cannabis use disorder, unusable sMRI due to
      motion artifact or poor signal-to-noise ratio that precluded accurate tissue
      segmentation (  n  =1) and incomplete drug use histories (  n  =2). Of the 42
      remaining cases, 22 were early onset users (onset of first use before age 16).
      Group categorization using onset of regular use as opposed to onset of first
      use maintained the same grouping (mean early onset of regular use=16.5, mean
      late onset of regular use=19.0). Regular use was defined as at least one time
      per week. To determine how age of onset of regular MJ use influenced our reported
      effects, we performed these analyses while covarying for age of onset of regular
      use (see  ).   summarizes demographic and substance use information according
      to onset status.   summarizes the correlation between age and identified marijuana
      use variables. Only MJ years of use and current age showed a statistically significant
      correlation. Participants were recruited based on self-reported daily MJ use
      and a positive urinalysis for THC metabolites at their baseline visit. All of
      the participants were screened via urinalysis for other drugs of abuse and were
      excluded if drugs (other than MJ) were detected. Participants were required
      to have used MJ for a minimum of 5000 lifetime occasions and self-report daily
      use (without >24h abstinence) for the last 60 days.   \nSample characteristics.

      acquisition \n  \nScanning sessions took place at the Advanced Imaging Research
      Center at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center three days following
      their initial visit. Another verification of THC metabolites via urinalysis
      was also performed before the scan. MRI images were collected using a 3T Philips
      whole-body scanner equipped with Quasar gradient subsystem (40mT/m amplitude,
      a slew rate of 220mT/m/ms). High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical scans were
      collected using a MPRAGE sequence: TR/TE/TI=2100/3.70/1100ms; flip angle=12;
      field of view=256mm256mm; slab thickness=160mm (along left-right direction);
      voxel size=1mm1mm1mm, Total scan time=3m 57s. \n\n\n#### Image processing \n  \nMPRAGE
      anatomical scans were pre-processed for surface-based analyses using FreeSurfer
      v5.3 semi-automated pipeline ( ). This semi-automated pipeline included spatial
      (Talairach) and signal intensity normalization of images, volumetric segmentation
      and subcortical labeling ( ,  ). Outer gray matter and white matter boundaries
      were then identified and reconstructed into a mesh of over 150,000 tessellated
      vertices to allow point-to-point surface measures ( ). Next, gyral anatomy is
      aligned to a standard spherical template using surface convexity and curvature
      measures. Resulting surfaces were inspected, blind to MJ onset status, to identify
      and correct any errors made during cortical reconstruction. Modifications to
      the volumes were made as necessary to correct for tissue misclassifications
      according to FreeSurfer''s wiki manual ( ). In preparation for analysis, each
      morphological measure for each case was co-registered to a standard template
      (fsaverage). Anatomical labels in FreeSurfer ( ) were used for interpretation
      of results. \n\n\n\n### Morphological measures \n  \n#### Cortical thickness
      \n  \nThe width of the cortical ribbon was measured as the distance between
      corresponding vertices of the white matter and gray matter surfaces at each
      vertex in the cortical mantel ( ). \n\n\n#### Graywhite matter ratio (GWR) \n  \nTo
      assess the quality of cortical ribbon definition, a tissue contrast between
      gray and white matter signal intensities was computed as a percent ratio (WG)/(.5*(W+G))
      (from pctsurfcon v1.11.2.1, inbuilt component of FreeSurfer pipeline v5.3, 2011).
      White matter signal intensities were measured at an absolute length of 1mm below
      the graywhite border surface and gray matter signal was measured 30% into the
      cortical ribbon ( ). \n\n\n#### Local gyrification index \n  \nThe cortical
      surface from FreeSurfer''s main pipeline is further processed to create an outer
      surface that encapsulates the gyral and sulcal curvature for each hemisphere,
      which serves as a basis for calculating a local gyrification index ( ). LGI
      is measured as the amount of cortex within the sulcal folds beneath the outer
      surface compared to the amount of visible cortex that touches the outer surface.
      Cortical maps are generated from repeated iterations of delineating a 25mm radius
      sphere on the outer surface and its corresponding point on the cortical surface
      using a matching algorithm. \n\n\n\n### Background and premorbid characteristics
      \n  \n#### Sample characteristics \n  \nAge, gender, education level, ethnicity,
      along with other background information, was obtained using a standard demographics
      questionnaire. The two-subtest administration of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale
      of Intelligence (Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning) provided estimates of intellect
      ( ). \n\n\n#### Substance use \n  \nThe Substance Use Disorder modules of the
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) ( ) were administered by a trained
      research assistant to assess for lifetime and current symptoms of abuse and
      dependence for alcohol, nicotine, MJ and other substances. The SCID interview
      also provided the onset of use information. A Time Line Follow-Back (TLFB) approach
      was used to quantify alcohol, nicotine, and MJ use patterns for 90 days prior
      to study participation ( ). Marijuana use in grams was obtained via self-report
      in response to probes aimed at quantifying their regular use. \n\n\n\n### Statistical
      analyses \n  \nStatistical analyses were conducted in SPSS 18.0 for behavioral
      and psychosocial measures whereas general linear model group comparisons on
      surfaced-based morphology measures were carried out FreeSurfer''s built-in application
      QDEC (v1.5). Independent samples   t  -tests, MannWhitney   U  -tests or chi-square
      tests, compared groups on background and demographic variables (see  ). Before
      statistical analysis was conducted, the dependent measures of cortical thickness,
      GWR and LGI were smoothed using a FWHM Gaussian filter with a width of either
      10 or 15mm. Separate univariate general linear model (GLM) was then used to
      model cortical thickness, GWR and LGI with onset status of MJ use as a between
      groups factor. The dependent variables were thickness, graywhite ratio or local
      gyrification index and the independent variables were either recent monthly
      MJ use in grams (MJ grams) or duration of MJ use (MJ years). Age and total drinks
      in the past 2 months were treated as nuisance covariates in the model. Using
      MJ years of use and MJ grams as independent predictors of interest allowed us
      to characterize and differentiate the latent developmental effects from cumulative
      and current effects of MJ use. The variable marijuana years of use was based
      on the participants response to the question For how many years have you been
      using marijuana regularly? Of note, an outlier in the early onset group was
      removed before the statistical comparisons were performed. \n\n\n\n## Results
      \n  \n### Cortical thickness \n  \nThere were no regions of group differences
      in cortical thickness by early onset status alone, controlled for age and alcohol
      use. However, MJ use characteristics were correlated with anterior dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex thickness based on onset status. Early onset users showed
      increased thickness with increased MJ grams while late onset users showed thinner
      cortex with increased MJ grams (  p  <0.05 uncorrected) ( ). The same pattern
      emerged with more years of MJ use being associated with thicker region of the
      right medial temporal lobe in the early onset users and the reverse for the
      late onset users (  p  <0.05 uncorrected) ( ).   \nClusters of significant age

      matter contrast \n  \nThere were no regions of group differences in graywhite
      matter contrast by early onset status alone, controlled for age and alcohol
      use. However, current MJ consumption (grams) and onset status were differentially
      correlated with graywhite matter contrast in a left anterior dorsal frontal
      region (  p  <0.05, FWE corrected). Increased graywhite contrast with heavier
      MJ use was seen in the early onset users and the opposite was seen in later
      onset users (heavier current use linked to decreasing GWR). The same pattern
      was seen between duration of MJ use in two prefrontal cortex clusters of the
      right dorsal frontal and medial orbitofrontal area   p  <0.05, FWE corrected  more
      years of MJ use were linked to greater GWR among early users ( ). \n\n\n###
      Gyrification \n  \nMJ use onset status alone showed no significant main effects
      above age and alcohol covariates. However, onset status was correlated with
      divergent patterns between local gyrification and MJ use, whereby early onset
      users showed decreasing LGI with increasing MJ consumption and longer duration
      of use in prefrontal cortex regions   p  <0.05, FWE corrected. The left hemisphere
      clusters encompassed the majority of the length of the middle lateral surface
      of the left cortex, including motor cortices, parietal lobe and multimodal integration
      areas ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study was designed to characterize
      the cortical architecture in adolescent onset MJ users by comparing early adolescent
      onset users to late adolescent onset in MJ use on measures of cortical thickness,
      gray/white matter contrast and gyrification. The primary finding was that early
      versus late onset MJ users showed a divergent pattern in cortical thickness,
      definition of the cortical ribbon and local gyrification with continued use
      through and beyond adolescent years. Specifically, early onset users showed
      cortical thickening, enhanced gray/white matter contrast, and decreased gyrification
      in association with more years of MJ use and current consumption of MJ in grams
      in frontal and temporal regions  areas that underlie higher order cognition
      including executive functioning, learning and memory. Findings were above and
      beyond effects of alcohol and current age, therefore, results are less likely
      to reflect morphological trends due to aging. \n\nOur findings did not find
      the expected age of onset differences previously reported in marijuana users
      ( ,  ). This inconsistency suggests that the age of onset effects may be more
      robust in brain white matter connectivity ( ) and function ( ) than brain surface
      morphometry. To date, the few studies that have described altered cortical morphology
      in MJ users have led to mixed findings.   identified brain regions with decreased
      sulcal depth suggestive of lower gyrification in a study of adult MJ users.   recently
      reported increased cortical thickness in the entorhinal cortex among 24 adolescent
      MJ users (mean age=17.7, mean MJ onset age=15.4) relative to peer controls.
      However, the authors also reported a negative relationship between cortical
      thickness and total MJ use in the right paracentral gyrus, and they observed
      consistent positive relationships in various brain regions between age of MJ
      onset and thickness. In the only other known adolescent study of cortical thickness
      and MJ, Lopez-Larson and colleagues studied 18 adolescent heavy MJ users (similar
      in age and MJ onset as  ) and reported mixed findings of increased thickness
      in prefrontal/insula regions and decreased thickness in posterior/temporal lobe
      areas in the MJ users compared to controls. In contrast to  ,   found areas
      of the frontal lobe and insula that were thinner with increased urine THC metabolites
      and thicker with earlier age of onset. Select findings from the current study
      align with aspects of both of these studies, with a consensus supporting findings
      of a negative dose-dependent relationship between MJ use and cortical thickness.
      Given the low availability of studies to compare, this consensus is very limited.
      Although Jacobus et al. and Lopez-Larson et al. found the opposite effect of
      age of onset on thickness, the pattern of divergence among early vs. late onset
      users in the current study is more consistent with the latter study, whereby
      we saw early onset users exhibit thicker cortex with continued MJ use. Taken
      together, findings of increased thickness related to early MJ onset accompanied
      by negative dose-dependent relationships with MJ exposure may reflect two distinct
      processes. One process may be specific to the interactions with cortical development
      during early adolescence, likely leading to a disruption in pruning, and, the
      other, specific to the pharmacological effect with heavy chronic MJ use. \n\nIn
      the only known study to examine the curvature-morphology of the cortex in adult
      MJ users,   identified decreased sulcal concavity and thinner sulci in 23MJ
      users compared to controls (  n  =44), also in prefrontal areas. However, they
      did not observe significant relationships with age, MJ onset age, or cumulative
      MJ use. It is interesting that the authors detected group level differences
      (MJ vs. controls) but no correlations with MJ use characteristics such as dose
      or age of onset, whereas our primary findings are the consistent effects of
      continued MJ use differing after early or late adolescent onset. There are substantial
      methodological explanations for this disparity. For example, the current study
      did not compare morphology in MJ users to a normative control sample, therefore,
      it is feasible that group-level differences may emerge with such a comparison.
      Likewise, we deliberately covaried for current age in order to control for brain
      changes with aging and thus optimize our interrogation of developmental effects
      of early onset age and of aspects of continued use. \n\nThe heterogeneity of
      MJ effects clearly suggests a multifactorial system of neurobiological processes
      involved. The primary results uphold that age of onset is a robust variable
      that differentiates heavy MJ users based on early versus late MJ onset. However,
      this group distinction relied on current use characteristics. Therefore, in
      the absence of group-level differences, the interactions between onset age and
      current use indicates that continued cannabis exposure and early adolescent
      developmental factors both contribute to a dynamic and sustained departure from
      what is expected based on developmental studies. \n\nTypical synaptic refinement
      processes during early adolescence are in the context of long-term depression
      and potentiation of cortical neurons in order to facilitate neuronal remodeling.
      Thus, the normal course of early adolescent development is uniquely vulnerable
      to disruption by MJ due to the electrochemical conditions and maturity of brain
      processes that would not present together again. Cass and colleagues tested
      the sensitivity of early adolescence cannabinoid exposure in an animal model
      ( ). They found that acute administration of cannabinoid agonists in early,
      middle and late adolescent rats led to a state of frequency-dependent disinhibition
      of neurons in the frontal cortex in the early-to-middle adolescent rats, but
      not in the late adolescent rats. Moreover, the authors also noted that adult
      rats previously exposed to cannabinoid agonists in adolescence displayed comparable
      neuronal disinhibition. Thus, by changing the inhibitory/excitatory landscape
      during adolescence, MJ can influence lasting changes to typical cortical remodeling
      during sensitive early adolescent years. \n\nThe sequence of pruning and myelination
      likely plays a formative role in lasting changes from early adolescent onset
      MJ use. With decreased synaptic elimination, our findings of greater GW border
      contrast may reflect greater proliferation of myelin at the boundary of the
      cortical ribbon where non-pruned synapses remained with linked axons. Findings
      of altered white matter tissue qualities are mixed in adolescent and adult MJ
      user samples. Some report both increases and decreases in fractional anisotropy
      (FA) and average water diffusion ( ) whereas others report consistent decreases
      in FA among adolescent MJ users ( ,  ) or null findings ( ). Two studies of
      diffusion tensor imaging in adult MJ users reported reduced FA in users compared
      to controls ( ,  ). In addition to equivocal findings, research is needed to
      address the microstructural changes that could result in altered definition
      of the cortical ribbon. For example, rather than whole brain techniques that
      assess diffusion measures along major white matter tracts, indices assessing
      axonal organization along radial and interneuron association fibers along the
      cortical ribbon are needed. This scenario played out could result in increased
      gray matter (thicker cortex from disrupted pruning) and the myelination of connections
      to these spared terminals would result in increased density of white matter
      at the cortical boundary. Without any known studies of adolescent development
      of the gray/white tissue contrast at the cortical border to serve as a point
      of comparison, we speculate that early adolescent disruption of pruning and
      subsequent myelination of connections at the cortical boundary would be reflected
      by increased GWR as we saw in the current study. \n\n\n## Limitations and conclusions
      \n  \nThe cross-sectional nature of this study limits causal attributions in
      terms of what we can infer to be directly related to the effects of MJ. Although
      a longitudinal design is optimal for addressing brain changes directly due to
      MJ, cross-sectional studies facilitate data-driven hypotheses that can be assessed
      directly in prospective studies. \n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the
      participants were not explicitly asked for possible years of abstinence during
      their period of regular use, which may have created possible inflation in reported
      duration of regular use. However, because the participants provided number of
      years of regular marijuana use, this inherently suggests continued, uninterrupted
      years of use. Concurrent nicotine use could have also influenced our reported
      results. But in the absence of a larger sample size and the presence of huge
      variance in nicotine use in the current sample, we were unable to verify the
      effect of nicotine use in the reported results. \n\nInterpretation of these
      findings is also limited by the lack of behavioral anchors for the observed
      morphological effects and lack of information on other aspects of developmental
      history that could further characterize the effects of marijuana during neurodevelopment.
      This is further limited by the absence of expected patterns based on normative
      data. Given the varied directions of effects and the small sample size, these
      findings should be replicated and be viewed as preliminary. \n\nTo conclude,
      early MJ use was linked to altered neurodevelopmental patterns in brain regions
      sub-serving higher-order cognitive process. Clinical implications include need
      for early, targeted intervention. Given that the most robust results were related
      to interactions between onset age and continued use through emerging adulthood,
      harm reduction approaches may be effective in moderating adolescent MJ use to
      levels that are less likely to cause long-term developmental changes. \n\n\n##

      the meaning of abstract mathematical symbols is a cornerstone of arithmetic
      learning in children. Studies have long focused on the role of spatial intuitions
      in the processing of numerals. However, it has been argued that such intuitions
      may also underlie symbols that convey fundamental arithmetic concepts, such
      as arithmetic operators. In the present cross-sectional study, we used fMRI
      to investigate how and when associations between arithmetic operators and brain
      regions processing spatial information emerge in children from 3rd to 10th grade.
      We found that the mere perception of a + sign elicited grade-related increases
      of spatial activity in the right hippocampus. That is, merely perceiving + signs  without
      any operands  elicited enhanced hippocampal activity after around 7th grade
      (1213 years old). In these children, hippocampal activity in response to a +
      sign was further correlated with the degree to which calculation performance
      was facilitated by the preview of that sign before an addition problem, an effect
      termed operator-priming. Grade-related increases of hippocampal spatial activity
      were operation-specific because they were not observed with  signs, which might
      evoke rote retrieval rather than numerical manipulation. Our study raises the
      possibility that hippocampal spatial mechanisms help build associations between
      some arithmetic operators and space throughout age and/or education.Keywords:
      Arithmetic, Development, Attention, Space, fMRI, Hippocampus1.IntroductionHumans
      are unique in their ability to represent abstract mathematical concepts by culturally
      invented symbols, such as Arabic numerals and arithmetic signs. Because these
      symbols are arbitrary, learning the relationship between their identity and
      the concept they represent is a challenge during early math education in children.
      Most prior studies have focused on the mechanisms supporting the acquisition
      of symbols representing numerical quantities (Piazza et al., 2007, Ansari, 2008,
      Holloway and Ansari, 2009, Lyons and Ansari, 2009, Mundy and Gilmore, 2009).
      However, efficient processing of symbols that convey fundamental arithmetic
      concepts (i.e., operators) may be an important and largely neglected aspect
      of arithmetic skills. This is suggested by the operator-priming effect (Roussel
      et al., 2002, Fayol and Thevenot, 2012, Mathieu et al., 2017), whereby the anticipated
      presentation of a + or - sign 150ms before a single-digit addition or subtraction
      problem facilitates problem-solving in adults.What aspect of the processing
      of an operator may cause the operator-priming effect in adults? A first possibility
      is that an arithmetic sign may automatically evoke a network of facts. For example,
      the perception of a + or - sign might pre-activate a network of additive or
      subtractive facts that would have been built in declarative memory after years
      of practice (Campbell and Xue, 2001, Ashcraft, 1992). Pre-activating such a
      network would facilitate the retrieval of the answer from memory when operands
      are presented. A second possibility is that an arithmetic sign may prime a specific
      procedure that would have been automatized after its repeated practice during
      arithmetic learning. For instance, Fayol and Thevenot argued that perceiving
      a + or - sign might trigger an automatized procedure that could be linked to
      the convocation of the mental number line and could correspond to a preparation
      for a quick left-to-right or right-to-left browsing of this mental line (Fayol
      and Thevenot, 2012). This proposal echoes the idea that adding or subtracting
      numbers involves rightward and leftward shifts of attention from a source to
      a target number along a mental map of numbers oriented from left to right, i.e.,
      the mental number line (MNL) (Hubbard et al., 2005, Masson and Pesenti, 2014,
      Mathieu et al., 2016, Pinheiro-Chagas et al., 2017). Pre-activating such a procedure
      would result in a facilitation of subsequent calculation when operands are presented,
      thereby explaining the operator-priming effect.Interestingly, two lines of evidence
      favor the procedural over the declarative interpretation of the operator-priming
      effect. First, the effect is not observed with the  sign and multiplication
      problems (Roussel et al., 2002, Mathieu et al., 2017). Multiplication problems,
      however, are explicitly learned by rote in school and multiplication is unanimously
      viewed as the operation having the strongest association with a network of facts
      in memory (Campbell and Xue, 2001, Galfano et al., 2003, Thibodeau et al., 1996).
      Therefore, the lack of operator-priming effect for multiplication problems is
      difficult to reconcile with the idea that the effect is due to associations
      between operators and networks of stored facts. Second, in line with Fayol and
      Thevenots proposal that + and  signs may prime a spatial scanning of the MNL,
      a recent study suggests that + and  signs do evoke spatial intuitions. Specifically,
      Pinhas et al. (2014) found that, when instructed to categorize + and  signs
      with left-hand or right-hand responses, adults tend to respond faster to + signs
      with the right hand than with the left hand, whereas they tend to respond faster
      to - signs with the left hand than with the right hand (Pinhas et al., 2014).
      Thus, + and  signs appear to have some automatic associations with the right
      and left sides of space, respectively.Using fMRI, we recently found that such
      spatial associations may stem from the fact that some arithmetic operators are
      automatically processed in brain regions involved in spatial attention in adults.
      We showed that the mere perception of a + sign elicits greater activity than
      the mere perception of a  sign in brain regions underlying overt spatial attention.
      These included the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the posterior superior parietal
      lobule (PSPL) (Mathieu et al., 2017). Thus, perceiving a + sign (but not a  sign)
      may be associated with a deployment of spatial attention in educated adults.
      Therefore, the rightward shifts of attention that have been posited to underlie
      addition problem-solving (Hubbard et al., 2005, Masson and Pesenti, 2014, Mathieu
      et al., 2016) might be primed by the mere preview of the addition sign (but
      not by the preview of a multiplication sign because multiplication is typically
      learned by rote and unlikely to be associated with movements along the MNL).
      Overall, there is mounting evidence that at least some arithmetic operators
      (e.g., + but not  signs) evoke spatial intuitions in adults, and that these
      intuitions may relate to the operator-priming effect.However, associations between
      operators and space are arguably not innate. Therefore, a fundamental outstanding
      question is how and when such associations emerge in the developing brain. To
      answer that question, we studied 34 children from 3rd to 10th grade while they
      performed 3 tasks. First, fMRI activity was measured while children were instructed
      to make eye saccades towards visually presented targets. This allowed us to
      precisely localize several regions of interest (ROIs) involved in spatial attention
      across children. Second, fMRI activity was measured in these spatial attention
      ROIs while children were presented with trials in which a + sign was displayed
      without any operands (hereafter addition sign-only trials). As in our previous
      study in adults (Mathieu et al., accepted), activity during the perception of
      addition sign-only trials was compared to activity associated with trials in
      which a  sign was displayed without any operands (hereafter multiplication sign-only
      trials) because these do not appear to evoke any specific intuitions in adults
      (Fayol and Thevenot 2012). This allowed us to identify the spatial attention
      ROIs in which activity in response to a + sign (as compared to a  sign) increases
      with age and/or education, as well as the developmental time course of these
      effects.1 Third, outside of the scanner, we asked subjects to perform an operator-priming
      task and measured the correlation between inter-individual differences in the
      size of the operator-priming effect and inter-individual differences in sign-related
      activity in spatial attention ROIs as a function of grade. This allowed us to
      evaluate when sign-related activity in spatial attention ROIs leads to an operator-priming
      effect in children.2.Material and methods2.1. ParticipantsForty-two right-handed
      children from 3rd to 10th grade participated in the study. All were native French
      speakers. Participants did not have prior history of neurological disease, psychiatric
      disorders, learning disabilities or attention deficits. All children and parents
      provided written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved
      by the local ethics committee (CPP Sud-Est-II). Families received 80 for their
      participation. Data from 8 subjects were excluded because of excessive head-movement
      in the scanner (see criteria in the Section 2.7., n=3), poor whole-brain coverage
      (i.e. susceptibility artefacts from dental braces, n=3) and unacceptably low
      performance during the task (i.e., lower than 50% accuracy on the sign-plus-operand
      trials, n=2). Therefore, the final sample consisted of 34 children (20 males)
      from 3rd to 10th grade (age range: 815, mean age=11.37, SD=1.84). For each child,
      a continuous measure of grade was calculated by taking into account the specific
      date within the grade year when that child was scanned. The whole sample (n=34)
      was evenly split into three groups as a function of grade: 11 children were
      from the lower grades group (grade 3.25.4; mean=4.4), 11 children were from
      the intermediate grades group (grade 5.66.9; mean=6.2), and 12 children were
      from the higher grades group (grade 7.610.2; mean=8.5).2.2. Standardized measuresChildren
      were administered standardized tests of intellectual and arithmetic abilities
      to ensure that there were no age differences with respect to those measures.
      Full-scale IQ was measured using the NEMI-2 (Cognet, 2006). Basic arithmetic
      knowledge was evaluated with the Math-Fluency subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson-III
      Tests of Achievement (WJ-III) (Woodcock et al., 2001). Across all participants,
      standardized (i.e., age-normalized) scores on IQ (mean=112; SD=10) and Math
      Fluency (mean=106; SD=16) tests were within the normal range. One-way ANOVAs
      with the between-subject factor group (lower, intermediate, higher grades) revealed
      no main effect of group on IQ (F(2,31)=0.591, p=0.560, BF10=0.29), indicating
      that age-normalized intellectual abilities were similar across groups. However,
      there was a main effect of group on Math Fluency (F(2,31)=5.867, p=0.007, BF10=7.24):
      Children from intermediate grades had a higher age-normalized score (mean=118;
      SD=18) than children from lower (mean=100; SD=11) and higher grades (mean=100;
      SD=13). Therefore, we included standardized Math-Fluency scores as nuisance
      covariate in all of our analyses.2.3. Behavioral sessionAfter standardized testing,
      children participated in a behavioral session during which they performed an
      operator-priming task adapted from Fayol and Thevenot (2012) and Roussel et
      al. (2002). Children were asked to evaluate 56 single-digit addition and 56
      multiplication problems composed of operands between 2 and 9. Problems were
      presented in both commutative orders. Tie problems were excluded. Problems with
      a sum smaller than or equal to 11 and a product smaller or equal to 24 were
      considered small. Other problems were considered large.In each trial, a problem
      was presented with an answer (Fig. 1a). The arithmetic sign was presented either
      150ms before (Negative SOA condition) or at the same time (Null SOA condition)
      as the operands (Fig. 1a). All problems were presented once in both SOA condition
      with a valid answer. Twenty-eight addition and 28 multiplication problems were
      also presented in both SOA condition with an invalid answer (obtained by adding
      or subtracting 1 to or from the valid answer). Trials were pseudorandomly ordered
      so that no more than three problems of the same type appeared consecutively.
      Problems with an invalid answer were randomly chosen across subjects and the
      order of blocks was counter-balanced between subjects. The experiment started
      with 8 practice trials.Open in a separate windowFig. 1Experimental design. (a)
      During the behavioral session, children (n=34) were asked to evaluate the result
      of single-digit addition and multiplication problems. For both operations, the
      arithmetic sign was presented either 150ms before (negative SOA trials), or
      at the same time as the operands (null SOA trials). (b) In the scanner, children
      (n=34) performed an arithmetic task during which they were presented with sign-only
      (left) and sign-plus-operands (right) addition, multiplication and baseline
      trials. In each trial, a sign (+,  or ) was presented at the center of the screen
      for 150ms. In sign-only trials, the trial ended with the presentation of the
      sign and was simply followed by the inter-trial period of fixation. In sign-plus-operands
      trials (filler trials), the + or  sign was immediately followed by a single-digit
      addition or multiplication problem (respectively) presented along an answer
      and the  sign was followed by 3 letters. In those cases, children had 5000ms
      to evaluate whether the answer of the problem was true or false or to indicate
      whether one of the 3 letters was a B.The experiment was controlled by Presentation
      software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA). Problems were displayed in white
      Arial 60-point font on a black background. All trials started with the presentation
      of a white central fixation dot for 1500ms, immediately followed by a red central
      fixation dot for 1000ms signaling that the problem was about to be presented,
      either in the negative SOA condition or in the null SOA condition (Fig. 1a).
      Subjects had a maximum of 5000ms to evaluate whether the response was valid
      or invalid as quickly as possible by pressing one of two keys on the computer
      keyboard.2.4. fMRI sessionDuring fMRI scanning, children performed a spatial
      attention localizer task and an arithmetic task. The spatial attention localizer
      task consisted in alternating blocks of fixation and saccades. During saccade
      blocks (n=9), participants were asked to make saccades towards several successive
      target dots. Each saccade block contained 16 target dots (0.2 visual angle)
      that appeared at random positions with an eccentricity of 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5
      or 5.5 in the left or right visual field for an average of 800ms (with a jitter
      of 200ms). During fixation blocks (n=9), participants were asked to maintain
      fixation on a central dot for 12,800ms. Block order was counterbalanced across
      children.During the arithmetic task, children were presented with sign-only
      and sign-plus-operands versions of addition and multiplication trials (Fig.
      1b). Each trial started with the presentation of either a + or a  sign at the
      center of the screen for 150ms. In sign-only trials (n=30), the trial ended
      with the presentation of the sign and was simply followed by the inter-trial
      period of fixation (see below). These sign-only trials were our trials of interest
      and allowed us to isolate neural activity due to the presentation of a sign
      alone. We also included in the experiment sign-plus-operands trials (n=50).
      In those filler trials, the + or  sign was immediately followed by a single-digit
      addition or multiplication problem (respectively) presented with an answer.
      Participants were asked to indicate whether the answer was true or false. The
      goal of these filler trials (for which associated activity would be difficult
      to interpret because any effects could be attributable to the anticipatory presentation
      of the operator, the appearance of the operands, or a combination of both of
      these factors) was only to keep children engaged and attentive in the scanner.
      They also induced an arithmetic context, thereby ensuring that the + and  signs
      presented in sign-only trials were perceived as arithmetic signs. Problems in
      sign-plus-operand trials were constructed following the same criteria as in
      the behavioral session. Finally, the baseline consisted in trials in which the
      arithmetic sign was replaced by an abstract non-arithmetic sign (i.e., ). We
      included 30 baseline sign-only trials (in which the  sign was presented in isolation)
      and 50 baseline sign-plus-operand trials (in which the  sign was followed by
      3 letters and participants had to indicate whether one of these letters was
      a B). All trials were followed by a variable period of visual fixation ranging
      from 3000ms to 3800ms. That period consisted in a central white fixation dot
      that turned red 1000ms before the onset of the next trial. The arithmetic task
      was decomposed in 4 functional runs. All trials were intermixed and the timing
      and order of trial presentation within each run was optimized for estimation
      efficiency using optseq2 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/optseq/). Behavioral
      responses were recorded using an MR-compatible response device.Stimuli were
      generated using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA).
      Prior scanning, children were familiarized with the fMRI environment during
      a practice session that took place after the standardized testing and the behavioral
      session. During this practice session, children learned to minimize head movement
      in a mock fMRI scanner. The actual scanning session took place no more than
      3 weeks after the practice session.2.5. Behavioral analysesRT data associated
      with the operator-priming task were normalized using a logarithmic transformation
      prior all analyses to improve the conformity of the data to the standard assumptions
      of parametric testing. Following Fayol and Thevenot (2012), mean RT was analyzed
      using planned comparisons that followed from a within-subject ANOVA with the
      factors Operation (Addition/Multiplication) and SOA (Negative/Null), conducted
      separately for each group. We report for all effects the corresponding Bayes
      factors (BF10), indicating the strength of evidence for the alternative hypothesis
      (H1) relative to the null hypothesis (H0). Substantial evidence in favor of
      the alternative hypothesis is typically suggested by a BF10 greater than 3 (Jeffreys,
      1961, Dienes, 2011).2.6. fMRI data acquisitionImages were collected with a Siemens
      Prisma 3T MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) at the CERMEP
      Imagerie du vivant in Lyon, France. The BOLD signal was measured with a susceptibility
      weighted single-shot EPI sequence. Imaging parameters were as follows: TR=2000ms,
      TE=24ms, flip angle=80, matrix size=128120, field of view=220206mm, slice thickness=3mm
      (0.48mm gap), number of slices=32. A high-resolution T1-weighted whole-brain
      anatomical volume was also collected for each participant. Parameters were as
      follows: TR=3500ms, TE=2.24ms, flip angle=8, matrix size=256256, field of view=224224mm,
      slice thickness=0.9mm, number of slices=192.2.7. fMRI preprocessingData analysis
      was performed using SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Functional images
      were corrected for slice acquisition delays and spatially realigned to the first
      image of the first run. Images were then spatially smoothed with a Gaussian
      filter equal to twice the voxel size. ArtRepair was used to help remove motion
      from the functional images prior to normalization (Mazaika et al., 2009). Volumes
      with rapid scan-to-scan movements of greater than 1.5mm were repaired by interpolation
      of the two nearest non-repaired scans. Each run with more than 5% of the total
      number of volumes replaced was removed from the analyses. A subject was excluded
      from further analysis if more than one run was removed. The number of volumes
      replaced did not differ between grade groups (F(2,31)=2.20; p=0.13). Finally,
      functional images were normalized into the standard MNI space (normalized voxel
      size, 223.5mm3).2.8. fMRI processingEvent-related statistical analysis was performed
      according to the general linear model (GLM). For the localizer task, brain activity
      associated with saccades and fixation blocks was modeled as epochs with onsets
      and offsets time-locked to the beginning and the end of each block. Each epoch
      was convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the time
      series data from each run were high-pass filtered (1/128Hz). Finally, serial
      correlations were corrected using an autoregressive AR(1) model. Following our
      previous study using the same task in adults (Mathieu et al., 2017), brain activity
      associated with sign-only trials during the arithmetic task was estimated using
      a finite impulse response (FIR) model. We modeled 8 time points with an interval
      of 2s (corresponding to one TR) ranging from the onset of the sign to 16s after
      the sign. The magnitude of the fMRI response for each type of sign-only trial
      was calculated by subtracting activity at the onset of the sign (i.e., 1st bin,
      or 0s after the onset) from the peak activity (i.e., 4th bin, or 8s after the
      onset). The time series data from each run were high-pass filtered (1/128Hz),
      and serial correlations were corrected using an autoregressive AR(1) model.2.9.
      Region of interest (ROI) definition and analysesThe present study used a Region-of-Interest
      (ROI) approach to analyze brain activity associated with sign-only trials in
      brain regions involved in the orienting of spatial attention in children. All
      ROIs were independently defined using the contrast of saccades versus fixation
      blocks in the spatial attention localizer task. All subject-specific contrasts
      were entered into a random effect (RFX) one-sample t-test across subjects. The
      RFX contrast map was then thresholded across the whole-brain using an uncorrected
      voxel-level threshold of p<0.001 and a false-discovery-rate (FDR) corrected
      cluster-level threshold of p<0.05 (Chumbley and Friston 2009). Using the SPM
      toolbox Marsbar (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/), ROIs were defined as 6-mm
      radius spheres around the peak coordinate of each region.Within each ROI and
      for each participant, we calculated the average response (parameter estimates)
      for + signs using the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline
      sign-only trials. Similarly, we calculated the average response for  signs using
      the contrast of multiplication sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials.
      Two analyses were performed in each ROI. First, we identified the ROI(s) in
      which a difference in fMRI activity between + and  signs emerged throughout
      age and/or education, using a 32 ANOVA with the between-subject factor group
      (lower/intermediate/higher grades) and the within-subject factor sign (+/).
      Second, we tested in these ROIs whether inter-individual differences in the
      fMRI response to an arithmetic sign were correlated with inter-individual differences
      in the size of the operator-priming effect (measured in the behavioral session)
      for each group. In all analyses, we report uncorrected P values as well as P
      values corrected for multiple comparisons across all identified ROIs using the
      Bonferroni procedure. Bayes factor are also reported.3.Results3.1. The spatial
      localizer task activates a brain network encompassing frontal, parietal, occipital
      and hippocampal regionsContrasting saccades to fixation blocks in the spatial
      attention localizer task, we first identified 10 clusters supporting the orienting
      of spatial attention across subjects: the bilateral Frontal Eye Field (FEF),
      bilateral Posterior Superior Parietal Lobule (PSPL), bilateral Middle Temporal
      Gyri (MTG), bilateral Middle Occipital Gyri (MOG), right dorsal Inferior Frontal
      Gyrus (dIFG), and right Hippocampus (see Table 1 and Fig. 2). Therefore, a large
      brain network was involved in the orienting of spatial attention across subjects.
      Each of these regions served as an ROI in subsequent analyses.Table 1Brain regions

      region identified by the spatial localizer task is increasingly activated in
      response to a + sign but not to a  sign throughout age and/or educationA 32
      ANOVA with the between-subject factor group (lower/intermediate/higher grades)
      and the within-subject factor sign (+/) was then conducted in each of the 10
      ROIs identified by the spatial attention localizer. We found an interaction
      between group and sign in the right hippocampus (F(2.30)=6.75, p=0.0038, pcorr=0.038;
      Fig. 3a and b), but not in any other ROIs (all Fs<3.44, all ps>0.046, all pscorr>0.46).
      Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for this interaction in
      the right hippocampus (BF10=11.53), while no or anecdotal evidence for such
      an interaction was found in the other ROIs (BF10<1.63). Follow-up t-tests in
      the hippocampus ROI revealed that children from higher grades (average grade=8.5)
      exhibited greater activity for addition than multiplication sign-only trials
      (t11=3.02, p=0.012), whereas there was no difference between signs in children
      from intermediate grades (average grade=6.2) (t10=0.87, p=0.41) and even a trend
      for less activity for addition than multiplication sign-only trials in children
      from lower grades (average grade=4.4) (t10=2.22, p=0.051). Bayes Factor analysis
      indicated substantial evidence for a difference of activity between addition
      and multiplication sign-only trials in children from higher grades (BF10=5.21),
      but evidence for this difference was absent in intermediate grades (BF10=0.41)
      and anecdotal in lower grades (BF10=1.69). Finally, across all groups, addition
      sign-only trials were associated with greater activity than baseline sign-only
      trials in children from higher grades (t11=2.63, p=0.023), but not in any other
      groups (all ts<1.32, all ps>0.21). Multiplication sign-only trials were associated
      with greater activity than baseline sign-only trials in none of the groups (all
      ts<1.38, all ps>0.20). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence
      for a difference between addition sign-only trials and baseline sign-only trials
      in children from higher grades (BF10=3.00), but no or anecdotal evidence in
      the other groups (all BF10s<0.60) and for multiplication sign-only trials (all
      BF10s<0.63). Overall, then, a difference in fMRI response to a + and a  sign
      emerged throughout age and/or education in the right hippocampus.Open in a separate
      windowFig. 3Grade-related changes of activity in the right hippocampus.(a) Location

      anatomical brain. (b) Activity in the right Hippocampus for addition versus

      trials (blue) in children from lower (n=11; grade 3.25.4; mean grade=4.4; mean
      age=9.4), intermediate (n=11; grade 5.66.9; mean grade=6.2; mean age=11.1) and
      higher grades (n=12; grade 7.610.2; mean grade=8.5; mean age=13.4). (c) Difference
      in activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials over grade
      in the right Hippocampus. *p<0.05; r represents the Pearson correlation coefficient.The
      findings above were confirmed by an additional correlation analysis in which
      grade was treated as a continuous predictor across all subjects. The difference
      in activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials was positively
      correlated with grade in the right hippocampus (r=0.53, p=0.001, pcorr=0.01;
      Fig. 3c). No other significant grade-related changes were found in any other
      regions (all rs<0.38, all ps>0.03, all pscorr>0.30). Bayes Factor analysis indicated
      substantial evidence for this correlation in the right hippocampus (BF10=20.97),
      but no or anecdotal evidence in any other ROIs (all BF10s<2.03). In the right
      hippocampus, the correlation between grade and the contrast of addition sign-only
      trials versus baseline sign-only trials, was also near significance (r=0.33,
      p=0.056; BF10=1.22).2 The correlation between grade and the contrast of multiplication
      sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials, however, was not significant
      (r=0.18, p=0.32; BF10=0.35).3.3. Spatial hippocampal activity in response to
      a + sign relates to an addition-priming effect in children from higher gradesWe
      then tested whether the hippocampal response to a + sign observed in children
      from higher grades was related to the operator-priming effect. To this aim,
      each child performed a version of the operator-priming task outside of the scanner
      (see Fig. 1a).First, we tested whether the results obtained by Fayol and Thevenot
      (2012) in adults (i.e., an operator-priming effect for addition but not for
      multiplication across subjects) could be extended to our children participants.
      Because children from lower grades had a performance close to chance on large
      problems (58%), we exclusively focused our analyses on small problems for which
      accuracy was significantly above chance in all groups (lower grades: 80%, intermediate
      grades: 92%, higher grades: 96%). Planned comparisons revealed an operator-priming
      effect for addition in children from higher grades (1491ms versus 1577ms; F(1,11)=8.11,
      p=0.016), but not in children from lower grades (2289ms versus 2417ms; F(1,10)=2.66,
      p=0.134) and intermediate grades (1530 versus 1509ms; F(1,10)=0.01, p=0.941).
      No operator-priming effect for multiplication was observed in any groups (lower
      grades: F(1,10)=3.50, p=0.091; intermediate grades: F(1,10)=1.52, p=0.246; higher
      grades: F(1,11)=0.14, p=0.715). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial
      evidence for an operator-priming effect with addition problems in children from
      higher grades (BF10=4.08), but no evidence in children from intermediate (BF10=0.30)
      and lower (BF10=0.83) grades. There was also no or anecdotal evidence for an
      operator-priming effect with multiplication problems in any group (higher grades:
      BF10=0.31; intermediate grades: BF10=0.55; lower grades: BF10=1.09).Second,
      we tested whether the size of the operator-priming effect in children (measured
      on small problems) was correlated to the magnitude of the response for addition
      sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials in the right hippocampus.
      Such a correlation was found to be highly significant in children from higher
      grades (r=0.82, p=0.0012, Fig. 4), surviving Bonferroni correction for multiple
      comparisons between the two conditions and across the three groups (pcorr=0.007).
      That is, children from higher grades who show greater responses to + signs in
      the right hippocampus are those who show larger operator-priming effect with
      addition problems. No significant correlation was found in children from lower
      (r=0.15, p=0.66 Fig. 4) and intermediate (r=0.24, p=0.48, Fig. 4) grades. Bayes
      Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for the correlation in children
      from higher grades (BF10=38.15), but no evidence in children from lower (BF10=0.40)
      and intermediate (BF10=0.46) grades. There was also no significant (and anecdotal
      evidence for a) correlation between the operator-priming effect for addition
      problems and the fMRI response to multiplication sign-only trials (compared
      to baseline sign-only trials) in the right hippocampus, in any of the groups
      (lower grades: r=0.06, p=0.87, BF10=0.37; intermediate grades: r=0.32, p=0.34,
      BF10=0.56; higher grades: r=0.51, p=0.09, BF10=1.28). Therefore, not only did
      we observe an operator-priming effect for addition in the only group in which
      we also observed a greater hippocampal response to + than  signs (i.e., children
      from higher grades), but inter-individual differences in the size of the operator-priming
      effect in that group was also related to hippocampal activity.Open in a separate
      windowFig. 4Hippocampus brain-behavior correlation over grade.Activity in the
      right hippocampus in response to addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials as a function of the operator-priming effect calculated in the behavioral
      session for addition problems in children from lower (n=11; grade 3.25.4; mean
      grade=4.4; mean age=9.4), intermediate (n=11; grade 5.66.9; mean grade=6.2;
      mean age=11.1) and higher grades (n=12; grade 7.610.2; mean grade=8.5; mean
      age=13.4). r represents the Pearson correlation coefficient.Third, we tested
      whether the correlation between the operator-priming effect and the contrast
      of addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials increased over
      grade. This was done by transforming the correlation coefficient in each group
      to a Fischers z score before comparing the groups using the cocor package (Diedenhofen
      and Musch, 2015). Although the correlation was not greater in children from
      intermediate than lower grades (z=0.19, p=0.43, one-tailed), it was significantly
      greater in children from higher than lower grades (z=2.07, p=0.019, one-tailed)
      and in children from higher than intermediate grades (z=1.88, p=0.030, one-tailed).
      Therefore, this brain-behavior correlation increased over grade.4.DiscussionIn
      the present study, we used fMRI and a cross-sectional design to investigate
      (i) how and when spatial processing related to the perception of an addition
      sign emerges in the developing brain, and (ii) to what extent it contributes
      to the emergence of an operator-priming effect.4.1. The mere perception of a
      + sign is associated with increased hippocampal spatial activity throughout
      age and/or educationIt has been shown that the processing of a + sign is associated
      with the right side of space (Pinhas et al., 2014) and activates brain regions
      involved in overt spatial attention in adults (Mathieu et al., 2017). Therefore,
      we expected arithmetic learning to be associated with increased recruitment
      of brain regions involved in spatial attention in response to the perception
      of a + sign throughout age and/or education in children. This was the case in
      a region of the right hippocampus that we identified in our spatial attention
      localizer task. Therefore, it is possible that hippocampal spatial mechanisms
      may scaffold the progressive association between an arithmetic operator (i.e.,
      a + sign) and spatial intuitions throughout age and/or education. There is increasing
      evidence that the hippocampal formation, and particularly the right hippocampus,
      may house a sense of space (Buffalo, 2015). Specifically, the right hippocampus
      has been extensively reported to support spatial representation and navigation
      in humans (Maguire et al., 1998, Burgess et al., 2002) as well as in non-human
      primates and rodents (O''keefe and Nadel, 1978, Bird and Burgess, 2008). For
      example, the hippocampus is typically activated when human participants learn
      to navigate through a mental representation of space (i.e., mental scanning)
      (Mellet et al., 2002, Spiers and Maguire, 2006). Interestingly, a recent study
      in monkeys demonstrated that neurons in the hippocampal formation may encode
      the direction of overt (Killian et al., 2015) as well as covert (Wilming et
      al., 2015) shifts of attention. Therefore, the hippocampal formation is likely
      a critical region for both representing a mental map of space and navigating
      along that map (Killian et al., 2012, Meister and Buffalo, 2016).Why would such
      a hippocampal spatial navigation mechanism be increasingly recruited by the
      mere perception of a+ sign throughout age and/or education? One possibility
      is that this mechanism might enable children to construct a detailed representation
      of numbers in mental space, as well as to navigate along that mental representation.
      Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence that numbers of increasing size are organized
      along a left-to-right mental map (i.e., the MNL) in adults (Fischer and Shaki
      2014). This spatial representation may enable individuals to add or subtract
      numbers by navigating from a source to a target number to the left or right
      of that MNL. This is supported by behavioral studies showing that addition and
      subtraction problem-solving is associated with rightward and leftward shifts
      of attention (Masson and Pesenti, 2014, Mathieu et al., 2016), as well as by
      a neuroimaging study indicating an overlap between the brain regions involved
      in overt shifts of attention and those involved in arithmetic calculation in
      adults (Knops et al., 2009). Such strategies may be acquired early by children,
      sometimes even explicitly in the classroom where addition and subtraction is
      often demonstrated on visual number lines. Yet, it is only with practice that
      they might become progressively attached to and evoked by an arithmetic operator
      such as a +, which might explain the grade-related increases of activity in
      this region in response to the + sign (and the fact that it is only by 7th grade
      that children exhibit significant activity in response to that sign).4.2. Hippocampal
      spatial activity in response to a + sign relates to the operator-priming effect
      in children from higher gradesA critical question is to what extent this automatic
      processing of a + sign in hippocampal spatial mechanisms is associated with
      childrens behavior. To answer this question, we asked all children to perform
      a version of the operator-priming task developed by Fayol and Thevenot (2012)
      and Roussel et al. (2002). First, we replicated the operator-priming effect
      observed in adults with addition problems (i.e., a facilitation of problem-solving
      when the operator is presented 150ms before the operands), but only in children
      from higher grades (after around 7th grade). Like in adults, this effect was
      specific to addition problems and not observed with multiplication problems.
      Thus, the perception of a + sign (but not that of a  sign) appears to pre-activate
      a process that is likely used to solve the subsequent problem in children from
      higher grades. More central to our current interest, we found that the size
      of the operator-priming effect in these children was highly correlated with
      the degree of activation of hippocampal spatial mechanisms in response to a
      + sign. This indicates that hippocampal spatial activity may be at the source
      of the operator priming-effect in older children, perhaps because these children
      might prepare for an attentional movement along the MNL as soon as a + sign
      is presented. Because no brain-behavior correlation was observed in younger
      children, extensive practice might be needed before such mechanisms are triggered
      by the mere perception of the sign.4.3. Hippocampal spatial activity in response
      to a + sign is transient in developmentStrikingly, the spatial brain mechanisms
      that respond to the mere perception of a + sign appear to be different in children
      and adults. That is, albeit we found increased hippocampal spatial activity
      throughout age and/or education in the present study, we did not identify these
      mechanisms in our previous study in adult participants using the exact same
      task (Mathieu et al., 2017). Rather, we found increased activity in response
      to a + sign in neocortical regions of the FEF and PSPL in adults. Therefore,
      the contribution of the hippocampus to the automatic processing of a + sign
      is likely transient. Such a transient involvement of the hippocampus is consistent
      with a wealth of studies that have demonstrated that the spatial representations
      initially supported by the hippocampus during learning become independent from
      this brain structure over experience and transferred to neocortical regions
      (Rosenbaum et al., 2004, Hirshhorn et al., 2012b). For example, longitudinal
      studies demonstrate that right hippocampal activity associated with learning
      to mentally navigate through a new environment disappears and is replaced by
      neocortical activity when individuals become familiar with that environment
      (Spiers and Maguire, 2007, Hirshhorn et al., 2012a). It is possible that the
      same phenomenon is at play here: The hippocampus may be involved in the early
      representation of (and navigation along) the MNL before that representation
      is transferred to neocortical regions of the fronto-parietal cortex. Future
      investigations with a wider age sample than in the present study are needed
      to test this hypothesis.4.4. Can right hippocampal involvement in the present
      study reflect mnemonic operations involved in learning arithmetic?Although there
      is no doubt that the hippocampus supports spatial processing (Burgess et al.,
      2002, Spiers and Maguire, 2007), this brain structure is also well known to
      support the encoding and consolidation of verbal declarative knowledge into
      long-term memory (Eichenbaum, 2004). In fact, previous developmental studies
      have largely explained the involvement of the hippocampus during arithmetic
      learning by referring to its role in declarative memory rather than spatial
      processing (Rivera et al., 2005, De Smedt et al., 2011, Cho et al., 2011, Cho
      et al., 2012, Qin et al., 2014). This interpretation relies on the claim that
      results of well-practiced arithmetic facts (e.g., 2+3 or 42) might become progressively
      retrieved from memory (rather than calculated) over the course of learning and
      development (Campbell and Xue, 2001). The hippocampus might thus support the
      encoding and consolidation of networks of arithmetic facts in children.Can the
      role of the hippocampus in declarative memory explain the operator-specific
      activity over grade (and correlation with the operator-priming effect) observed
      in the region of the right hippocampus identified by our spatial localizer task?
      We acknowledge that we did not have a task identifying processes involved in
      declarative memory. Thus, even if the right hippocampus is usually more associated
      with spatial than mnemonic processes (Burgess et al., 2002), it is possible
      that the hippocampal cluster that we identified as being involved in spatial
      processing may also be involved in some aspects of declarative memory. One might
      thus argue that grade-related increases of activity in relation to + signs reflect
      the progressive association between a + and a network of additive facts. This
      explanation, however, can be ruled out by an examination of activity related
      to  signs. Because single-digit multiplication problems are almost exclusively
      learned by rote in school, multiplication is the operation that is perhaps the
      most associated with a network of stored facts in the literature (Campbell and
      Xue, 2001). Thus, if increased hippocampal activity in relation to + signs were
      due to the progressive building of a network of additive facts, increased activity
      in that same region should have been observed during the perception of  signs
      (perhaps even more so for the perception of + signs). Yet, this is not the case.
      Not only did we not find any grade-related increase of activity for  signs in
      the hippocampal cluster identified by our spatial localizer task, but activity
      was significantly greater for + than  signs in higher graders (who are as proficient
      in single-digit multiplication as addition). Similarly, no operator-priming
      effect was observed for multiplication problems in higher graders, indicating
      that the operator-priming effect observed for addition is likely to have little
      to do with the pre-activation of a network of stored facts (because this should
      be also observed for multiplication). Therefore, the specificity of our results
      to + signs (as compared to  signs) in the right hippocampus ROI makes it very
      unlikely that our results are related to mnemonic operations. In our view, emerging
      associations between + signs and spatial intuitions related to the MNL are the
      best explanation of the effects reported here.Of course, the fact that the role
      of the hippocampus in declarative memory is unlikely to explain our operator-specific
      findings in the right hippocampus ROI does not mean that hippocampal mechanisms
      supporting mnemonic operations do not contribute to arithmetic learning. Instead,
      they indicate that the hippocampus might contribute to arithmetic learning through
      its role in both declarative memory and spatial processing. Interestingly, the
      operator-specific activity observed in our (spatially localized) right hippocampal
      cluster is not observed in a mirror (left lateralized) cluster that is not activated
      in the localizer contrast (see Supplementary information). In that mirror region,
      no difference was observed between activity related to + and  signs in any group
      of children (and left hippocampal activity was not related to the operator-priming
      effect). Thus, the developmental effect reported here appears to be restricted
      to the right hippocampus. This specificity suggests that the observed developmental
      changes in the right hippocampus may not simply reflect general brain maturation
      but rather mechanisms that are specific to arithmetic learning.4.5. LimitationsIt
      is worth acknowledging here 2 potential limitations of the present work. First,
      as is the case for any cross-sectional fMRI studies, our study is correlational
      in nature. Thus, although our findings are consistent with the idea that the
      right hippocampus might scaffold the progressive association between (at least
      some) arithmetic operators and space throughout age and/or education, future
      studies might specifically investigate the causal role of these hippocampal
      mechanisms. Second, our finding of a correlation between grade and the processing
      of an addition sign in the right hippocampus (see Fig. 3C) relies on a relatively
      large sample size of 34 children. However, other findings involve subgroups
      of participants and therefore rely on smaller sample sizes. In particular, null
      findings in relation to these subgroups might be difficult to interpret because
      of potential lack of power. For example, whereas we found an operator-priming
      effect in children from higher grades and no effect in children from intermediate
      grades, there was no significant difference between these groups in terms of
      response times in negative SOA trials (1491ms versus 1530ms; t21=0.21; p=0.84;
      BF10=0.39). Behavioral studies focusing on the operator-priming effect in children
      might test whether this difference emerges with larger sample sizes. More generally,
      future studies are needed to improve our understanding of the present results.5.ConclusionIn
      sum, our findings suggest that the right hippocampus might contribute to the
      progressive association between (at least some) arithmetic operators and space
      throughout age and/or education. Therefore, our study raises the possibility
      that increased hippocampal activity during arithmetic learning in children may
      be explained by the role of this structure in spatial representations as well
      as in declarative memory.Conflict of interestThe authors declare no competing

      and disguise the goal of the experiment, we also included trials in which a
      + or a  sign was followed 150ms later by operands and participants were asked
      to solve the problem. The low temporal resolution of fMRI, however, makes it
      impossible to dissociate activity associated with the sign from activity associated
      with operands in these problems. Therefore, they were simply designed to be
      filler trials.2There was a tendency for a correlation between grade and activity
      associated with addition sign-only trials (versus fixation) in the right hippocampus
      (r=0.29, p=0.09; BF10=0.82), but no correlation for baseline sign-only trials
      (versus fixation) (r=0.10, p=0.58; BF10=0.25). Thus, the correlation between
      grade and the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials was more likely driven by changes of activity in addition sign-only trials
      than in baseline sign-only trials.Appendix ASupplementary data associated with

      Significance Statement \n  \nPsychopathic criminals are commonly seen as instrumentally
      abusive and emotionally callous, yet social challenges often trigger uncontrolled
      emotional behavior in those individuals. This study shows how this paradoxical
      aspect of psychopathy relates to altered neuroendocrine interactions between
      testosterone and the cerebral circuit coordinating emotional action tendencies.
      The anterior prefrontal cortex, a region necessary for controlling emotional
      behavior, showed blunted responses and reduced connectivity with the amygdala
      in psychopathic criminals engaged in controlling their emotional action tendencies.
      This cerebral pattern was strongest in psychopathic individuals with high endogenous
      testosterone levels. This neuroendocrine signature of altered emotional control
      highlights the relevance of considering the testosterone level of individual
      psychopathic patients during treatment of their impulsive behavior. \n\n\n##
      Introduction \n  \nPsychopathy is a disorder often associated with blunted emotional
      responding and increased goal-directed behavior ( ;  ). On the other hand, offenders
      with psychopathy also show a paradoxical increase in impulsive behavior and
      uncontrolled aggression after emotional provocations ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), which
      may be related to heightened testosterone levels ( ;  ). These two aspects of
      psychopathy are also distinguished within the most commonly used psychopathy
      checklist, the Psychopathy Check List-Revised (PCL-R), potentially reflecting
      differing traits among psychopathic individuals ( ;  ). Importantly, enhanced
      difficulty in controlling emotional impulses, a crucial component of criminal
      psychopathy associated with PCL-R factor 2, has been largely neglected by cognitive
      neuroscience. Yet, the clinical relevance of this cognitive trait is large:
      reduced behavioral control and increased impulsivity predict recidivism in psychopathic
      offenders ( ), and behavioral control in psychopathic offenders appears particularly
      fragile when dealing with emotionally relevant behavior ( ;  , chapter 7;  ).
      Accordingly, understanding the neurobiological systems underlying the altered
      control of social emotional behavior in psychopathic individuals is relevant
      for improving currently available interventions, which are plagued by low treatment
      response and high recidivism ( ). Here we study those neuroendocrine systems
      in a group of psychopathic offenders engaged in an experimental paradigm that
      requires rule-driven control of emotional behavior. \n\nPrevious investigations
      of psychopathy showed altered reactivity to emotional material in several brain
      regions that include the anterior part of the PFC (aPFC) and the amygdala (
      ;  ;  ). Furthermore, individuals with psychopathy showed decreased functional
      and anatomical connectivity between the PFC and amygdala at rest ( ;  ), an
      indication that these brain regions might have a reduced ability to interact
      effectively. Studies in healthy participants have shown that this cerebral circuit
      is necessary for implementing the control of emotionally relevant actions (
      ). Namely, aPFC downregulates neural processing in the amygdala during emotional
      control ( ), while high levels of endogenous testosterone reduce such control-related
      connectivity between aPFC and amygdala ( ). Those findings raise the possibility
      that aPFCamygdala connectivity is altered when psychopathic offenders need to
      control emotionally relevant actions, with high levels of endogenous testosterone
      exacerbating that altered connectivity. \n\nThis study tests these hypotheses
      by measuring brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      in 15 psychopathic criminals and 19 matched healthy control subjects dealing
      with a challenge to control their emotional behavior. The psychopathy sample
      was obtained by focused and comprehensive screening excluding confounds that
      are frequently associated with random criminal sampling (e.g., medication use,
      comorbidity). The social approachavoidance (AA) task was used to provide reliable
      indexes of control over social emotional behavior ( ;  ;  , ). Behaviorally,
      psychopathic participants previously showed altered AA behavior to explicitly
      approaching and avoiding emotional faces ( ). Similar findings occurred after
      testosterone administration in healthy participants ( ). Interestingly, a more
      subtle version of the AA task has been shown to be sensitive to testosterone-related
      alterations and genetic variations in the aPFCamygdala pathway, while keeping
      behavior constant across experimental groups ( ), opening the way for isolating
      neural vulnerability factors ( ) in psychopathy. During this task, participants
      respond to affective faces (happy, angry) presented for a short time with approach
      and avoidance movements. Automatic emotional tendencies (approachhappy and avoidangry
      faces; affect-congruent response conditions) need to be controlled during affect-incongruent
      response conditions in order to apply the counterintuitive action of approaching
      angry and avoiding happy faces ( ;  ). Healthy participants respond more slowly
      and rely more strongly on the aPFC when emotional control is required, operationalized
      by the differences evoked between affect-incongruent and affect-congruent trials
      ( ;  ). Accordingly, this study tests whether exerting control over emotionally
      relevant actions is reflected by reduced functionality of the aPFCamygdala circuit
      in psychopathic individuals, suggesting less prefrontal regulation of emotional
      actions. In addition, it sets out to test whether this alteration is intensified
      by high levels of endogenous testosterone. \n  \nThe emotional control AA task.
      The AA task involved the presentation of happy and angry faces, and the performance
      of approach and avoidance responses. During the AA task, the participants had
      to select their response according to the perceived emotion of the face. At
      the beginning of each block of 12 trials, the participants received instructions
      on whether to pull the joystick toward themselves (approach) or push it away
      (avoid) when seeing a face with a particular emotion. When viewing happy or
      angry faces, automatic stimulusresponse tendencies trigger corresponding approach
      or avoidance actions. These tendencies could be followed during the affect-congruent
      condition (approachhappy, avoidangry). In contrast, when task instructions required
      participants to avoid happy faces or to approach angry faces, automatic tendencies
      needed to be controlled and overridden with the instructed response (affect-incongruent
      condition). Participants saw the faces and moved the joystick while lying in
      a MR scanner (top left corner of the table). Figure adapted from  ). \n  \n\n##
      Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe psychopathic group was
      recruited from in-patient populations of the Pompestichting and Oldenkotte,
      forensic psychiatric institutes (TBS-clinics) in the Netherlands. TBS-clinics
      are facilities for criminal offenders with a mental disorder treated on behalf
      of the state. \n\nSeventeen male psychopathic violent offenders (age range,
      23-56 years) participated; all had received a diagnosis with a PCL-R score of
      26, according to European standards ( ;  ;  ). PCL-R consensus scores were obtained
      by trained clinicians based on a structured PCL-R interview, clinical status,
      and history. After the independent scoring, the two raters compared their scores
      and came to the consensus score. When no consensus could be found, a third independent
      rater was included in the process. Dutch versions of the National Adult Reading
      Test and Edinburgh Handedness Inventory were used to assess IQ levels and right-handedness
      ( ;  ). Twenty-one healthy male control subjects (HCs) matched for age, right-handedness,
      and IQ, without criminal records or history of psychiatric disorders, were recruited
      from staff of the clinics. All participants received oral and written information
      about the experiment and gave written informed consent according to guidelines
      of the local ethics committee (Commissie Mensengebonden Onderzoek region Arnhem-Nijmegen).
      Psychiatric exclusion criteria consisted of neurological, axis-I, and axis-II
      disorders, besides antisocial personality disorder for the psychopathic group.
      They were screened for these exclusion criteria by trained psychologists using
      Dutch versions of the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID;  ) and Mini-International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI;  ) for   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      of Mental Disorders  , 4th edition, disorders. All participants were asked about
      drug use and medical/neurological history to exclude the following: alcohol
      use of >3 units/day, cannabis, or other illicit drug use 1 week before, psychotropic
      medication other than oxazepam 5 d before, 1 unit of alcohol or oxazepam use
      within 24 h before the experiment; history of trauma capitis; visual and auditive
      disorder; and neurological disorder. Furthermore, general exclusion criteria
      for MRI experiments were applied. Two psychopathic patients (PPs) and two HCs
      were excluded from the analyses, due to incomplete scanning procedures (1 PP,
      1 HC) or too many errors on the task (>16%, representing the outlier with a   z  -score
      >3). The final groups did not differ in age, IQ, and handedness (see  ). \n  \nDemographical
      data \n    \n\n### Procedure \n  \nTwo test sessions took place. During the
      first session, right-handedness, IQ, MINI, and SCID were assessed. During the
      second session, participants completed several questionnaires upon arrival in
      the laboratory, including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to measure
      anxiety levels ( ). Next, they provided saliva for the testosterone measurement.
      Afterward, participants were positioned in the 1.5 T MR scanner and familiarized
      with the task setup. Immediately after this, the fMRI session started with the
      AA task (duration, 30 min) followed by another task (not included in this report).
      After a short break outside the scanner, the anatomical scan (duration, 5 min)
      and an unrelated task were acquired in the side-by-side 3 T MR scanner. \n\n\n###
      Experimental task \n  \nThe AA task consisted of 24 blocks (with 12 trials per
      block and a baseline period of 21-24 s) during which participants had to respond
      to visually presented faces either by pulling a joystick toward themselves (approach)
      or by pushing it away from themselves (avoid;  ). The participants had to categorize
      faces as happy, angry, and neutral (filler items), based on their affective
      expressions. During each block, two of the three affective expressions were
      presented as stimuli, because only two responses could be given to categorize
      the stimulus. This resulted in six different block types each used four times,
      representing the affect (happyangry, happyneutral, angryneutral)  movement (approachavoid)
      combinations. At the start of each block, participants received written instructions
      regarding the required response mapping. The affect  movement combinations were
      pseudorandomly and evenly distributed (with no affect combination repetition),
      and the combination of the first block was counterbalanced across participants.
      Within each block, affective expressions and gender types were pseudorandomly
      presented, avoiding three or more sequential presentations of the same expression/gender,
      and two presentations of the same facial model. Each face was presented for
      100 ms, preceded by a 300 ms blank screen, and followed by the participants
      response, a blank screen, and by a pseudorandom intertrial interval (ITI; 1-3
      s). A baseline period of 21-24 s preceded each block. The faces were from 36
      models (18 male) obtained from several databases ( ;  ;  ; ), each showing all
      expressions. The pictures were in grayscale, matched for brightness and contrast
      values, and displayed against a black background. To exclude influence from
      hair and nonfacial contours, the faces were trimmed. Joystick displacements
      of >80% along the sagittal plane within 2 s from stimulus presentation were
      marked as valid responses. Invalid responses were signaled for 1 s with written
      feedback stating you did not move your joystick far enough. After moving the
      joystick, participants had to return to the starting position (defined as the
      central area extending 20% along the sagittal plane) before the end of the ITI.
      Otherwise, visual feedback indicated return the joystick to the starting position,
      and the ITI was repeated after participants returned the joystick. The training
      at the beginning consisted of six blocks; one block of eight trials for each
      of the six affect  movement combinations. Different visual stimuli were used
      during the training and scanning blocks. \n\n\n### Materials and apparatus \n  \nThe
      fMR images were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner (Avanto, Siemens Medical Systems)
      with an eight-channel head coil using a multiecho generalized autocalibrating
      partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) sequence [ ; repetition time (TR),
      2.14 ms; five echo times (TEs), 9.4/21/33/44/56 ms; 34 transversal slices; ascending
      acquisition; distance factor, 17%; effective voxel size, 3.3  3.3  3.5 mm; field
      of view (FOV), 212 mm]. High-resolution anatomical images were acquired on a
      3 T MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil using a magnetization prepared rapid
      gradient echo sequence (TR, 2300 ms; TE, 3.03 ms; 192 sagittal slices; voxel
      size, 1.0  1.0  1.0 mm; FOV, 256 mm). \n\nAn MR-compatible joystick (Fiber Optic
      Joystick, Current Designs; sampling rate, 550 Hz) was placed on participants
      abdomens to ensure comfortable push-and-pull movements ( ). Participants wore
      MR-compatible headphones to reduce scanner noise (Commander XG MRI Audio System,
      Resonance Technologies). Stimuli were projected at the center of a screen, viewed
      via a mirror above the participants head, with a visual angle of 4  6 (width  height).
      Stimuli presentation and acquisition of joystick positions were controlled by
      a PC running Presentation version 13 ( ). \n\n\n### Salivary measurements \n  \nParticipants
      filled two Salicaps (IBL) with saliva for testosterone measurement, which were
      stored at 25C. Testosterone concentration was measured using competitive chemiluminescence
      immunoassay with a sensitivity of 0.0025 ng/ml (IBL International, Tecan). Intra-assay
      and interassay coefficients are between 10% and 12%. To control variables influencing
      testosterone levels, participants were instructed to refrain from any food,
      cigarettes, and drinks (except water) for 1 h before the experiment. \n\n\n###
      Behavioral analysis \n  \nBehavioral data was analyzed using MATLAB version
      7.9 (MathWorks) and PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc.). First, to obtain a precise
      measure of movement onset [reaction time (RT)], the joystick movement for each
      trial was reconstructed using the joystick displacement measurements. Excluded
      trials showed a joystick movement in the wrong direction, an extreme RT (<150
      or >1500 ms), peak velocity (<0.1 cm/s), or movement time (>400 ms); or an error
      rate of above chance level in a block (in that case, the whole block was excluded).
      RTs and testosterone levels were log transformed to obtain a normal distribution.
      Second, following previous studies ( ;  ), we conducted three-way repeated-measures
      ANOVA (ANCOVArm) on the mean RT and error rates, with factors group (PP, HC),
      movement (approach, avoid), and valence (happy, angry), including standardized
      testosterone and STAI state as covariate. A measure of anxiety (STAI) was included
      to account for the effects of psychopathy type (e.g., primary vs secondary);
      and the possible effects on emotional behavior, hormonal levels, amygdala, and
      prefrontal cortex functioning ( ;  ;  ; ). The -level was set at   p   < 0.05.
      \n\n\n### Functional MRI data \n  \n#### Single-subject analyses \n  \nImaging
      data were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping;  ).
      The first four volumes of each participants dataset were discarded to allow
      for   T   equilibration. Given the multiecho GRAPPA MR sequence (Poser et al.,
      2006), head motion parameters were estimated on MR images with the shortest
      TE (9.4 ms), since these are least affected by possible artifacts. These motion
      correction parameters, estimated using a least-squares approach with six rigid
      body transformation parameters (translations, rotations), were applied to the
      five echo images collected for each excitation. After spatial realignment, the
      five echo images were combined into a single MR volume using an optimized echo
      weighting method (Poser et al., 2006). The time series for each voxel was temporally
      realigned to the first slice in time. The   T  -weighted image was spatially
      coregistered to the mean of the functional images. The fMRI time series were
      transformed and resampled at an isotropic voxel size of 2 mm into standard Montreal
      Neurological Institute (MNI) space by unified segmentation and normalization
      using the coregistered   T  -weighted image ( ). The normalized functional images
      were spatially smoothed using an isotropic 8 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian
      kernel. \n\nThe fMRI time series of each subject were further analyzed using
      an event-related approach in the context of general linear model, including
      the following effects: approachhappy, approachneutral, approachangry, avoidhappy,
      avoidneutral, and avoidangry. Trials excluded from behavioral analyses and periods
      of instructions or feedback were modeled as regressors. Vectors describing the
      time of picture presentation (onset) and RT of each event (duration) were convolved
      with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Potential confounding effects
      of residual head movement were modeled using original, squared, cubic, first-order,
      and second-order derivatives of the movement correction parameters ( ). Three
      further regressors, describing the time course of signal intensities of white
      matter, CSF, and the portion of the MR image outside the skull were also added.
      This procedure accounts for image intensity shifts due to hand movements within
      or near the magnetic field of the scanner ( ). Finally, fMRI time series were
      high-pass filtered (cutoff 120 s). Temporal autocorrelation was modeled as a
      first-order autoregressive process. \n\n\n#### Group analyses \n  \nConsistent
      effects across participants and between groups were tested using a random-effects
      multiple regression analysis that included six contrast images (approachhappy,
      approachneutral, approachangry, avoidhappy, avoidneutral, avoidangry) per participant.
      Together, these images represented the estimated cerebral effects from 12 conditions
      of the experimental design [group (PP, HC)  valence (happy, neutral, angry)  response
      (approach, avoid)]. Standardized log-transformed testosterone and standardized
      STAI state levels were included in the multiple regression analysis as condition-specific
      [group (PP, HC)  valence (happy, neutral, angry)  response (approach, avoid)]
      regressors, generating another 12 regressors per variable. \n\nAll analyses
      assessed the congruency effect, reflecting task-related differences of affect-incongruent
      (approachangry, avoidhappy) versus affect-congruent trials (approachhappy, avoidangry;  ;  ).
      We considered two effects. First, to test for general effects of congruency,
      we performed an analysis on the congruency effect over both groups and for each
      group separately. When assessing the effects of one group explicitly, we also
      tested whether those effects were specific to that group and were significantly
      weaker in the other group (at   p   < 0.05 uncorrected) by masking the statistical
      map describing the congruency effect in the first group (using multiple comparisons
      correction, see below) with the statistical map describing the group  congruency
      contrast. Second, to test whether testosterone differentially modulated the
      control of emotionally relevant actions in the groups, we performed a group  congruency
      contrast on the regressor parametrizing interindividual differences in testosterone
      on task-related conditions. If such an interaction is present, the testosterone
      modulation on the congruency effect of each group separately is considered.
      In addition to whole-brain analyses, we used a volume of interest (VOI) on coordinates
      previously found to be modulated by testosterone during the congruency effect
      in healthy students (two 8-mm-radius spheres centered on the following MNI coordinates:   x  ,
      30;   y  , 58; and z, 2; and   x  , 32;   y  , 54; and   z  , 8;  ). \n\nThe
      reported activations are corrected for multiple comparisons using familywise
      error (FWE) correction. For whole-brain analyses, we made inferences at cluster
      level (FWE:   p   < 0.05, corresponding to a cluster size of >140 on the basis
      of intensity threshold,   p   < 0.001). For VOI analyses, we made inferences
      at voxel-level (FWE corrected,   p   < 0.05;  ;  ). Anatomical inference is
      drawn by superimposing SPM showing significant signal changes on structural
      images of participants. For anatomical accuracy, we report only activation peaks
      in gray matter. Anatomical landmarks were identified using the atlas of  . Brodmann
      areas (BAs) were assigned by superimposing significant SPM on the SPM anatomy
      toolbox ( ) and MRIcron template ( /). \n\n\n\n### Connectivity analyses \n  \nThe
      aim of the following analysis was to test whether inter-regional coupling of
      the aPFC (see Results) with the amygdala and other brain regions during the
      congruency effect was different between the groups and modulated by testosterone.
      To test for these effects, we used the psychophysiological interactions (PPIs)
      method ( ). More specifically, we tested for significant differences between
      the regression coefficients of each voxel over the right aPFC during the affect-incongruent
      versus the affect-congruent conditions. To select voxels to be included in the
      VOI, we used the following anatomical constraints ( ): for each participant,
      selected voxels fell within a sphere with a radius of 4 mm around the peak voxel
      corresponding to the activated cluster of the congruency effect over both groups
      (coordinates:   x  , 30;   y  , 58;   z  , 14; see Results). Participant specific
      contrast images were generated describing the PPI between the time courses of
      the right aPFC VOI and affect-incongruent versus affect-congruent conditions.
      Group differences and testosterone modulations on task-related coupling between
      the aPFC and other regions were then assessed using a multiple regression design
      on participant-specific contrast images with their corresponding testosterone
      (log-transformed, standardized) and STAI state (standardized) levels as subject-
      and group-specific regressors. In addition to whole-brain analyses, we assessed
      significant voxel-level effects (FWE corrected for multiple comparisons,   p   <
      0.05) within the amygdala, defined on the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas
      ( ) using the WFU PickAtlas tool ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral
      results \n  \nFifteen psychopathic criminals (PPs; PCL-R score of 26, according
      to European standards ( ;  ;  ) and 19 HCs (for demographics, see  ) were included
      in the analyses. Participants performed the task accurately and consistently
      (error rates: PPs, 7.9%; HCs, 7.3%; omissions: PPs, 1.6%; HCs, 1.5%; undefined
      responses: PPs, 0.9%; HCs, 0.3%;  ). \n  \nRTs and error rates for each group
      and factor of the AA task \n    \nA significant movement  valence interaction
      for the RTs indicated that, over groups, participants responded more slowly
      during affect-incongruent (approachangry, avoidhappy) than during affect-congruent
      trials (approachhappy, avoidangry;   F   = 10.4,   p   = 0.003;  ). This congruency
      effect replicates the behavioral results from previous fMRI studies ( ;  ).
      Furthermore, there were main effects of movement (  F   = 26.3,   p   < 0.001)
      and valence (  F   = 28.7,   p   < 0.001), reflecting the slowing of avoidance
      movements and responses to angry faces in general ( ). There were no significant
      effects involving group, including no main effect (  p   > 0.3). The congruency
      effect correlated positively (without corrections for multiple comparisons)
      with the PCL-R total score (  p   = 0.048,   R   = 0.517, respectively). Excluding
      anxiety from the analyses did not affect the outcomes. Moreover, when including
      the neutral conditions in the analyses, the movement  valence (happy, neutral,
      angry) interaction for RTs remained significant (  F   = 5.5,   p   = 0.010),
      showing that neutral approachavoidance effects are intermediary compared with
      happy and angry ( ). \n  \nBehavioral results. Mean RTs (SEM) for the affect-congruent
      and affect-incongruent conditions of the AA task for the healthy control subjects
      and psychopathic offenders. The groups were significantly slower to provide
      affect-incongruent responses (approachangry; avoidhappy) than affect-congruent
      responses (approachhappy; avoidangry), with no significant group differences.
      \n  \nFor the error rates, the three-way ANCOVArm showed main effects of movement
      (  F   = 27.5,   p   < 0.001), valence (  F   = 25.9,   p   < 0.001), and testosterone
      (  F   = 4.6,   p   = 0.040), and a valence  testosterone interaction (  F   =
      4.3,   p   = 0.047). There were no other significant effects for the error rates
      (  p   > 0.15). \n\nEndogenous testosterone levels [median (SD): PPs, 101 pg/ml
      (70 pg/ml); HCs, 90 pg/ml (46 pg/ml)] and state anxiety levels [STAI mean (SD):
      PPs, 32 (8); HCs, 32 (5)] did not differ between groups (  p   > 0.4), and showed
      no correlations with psychopathy (PCL-R) scores or with each other (  p   >
      0.1). \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### Multiple regression analyses \n  \nTo
      assess the two main questions of this study, we isolated cerebral structures
      showing stronger responses during affect-incongruent than affect-congruent trials
      (congruency effect), and cerebral structures in which the congruency effect
      was modulated by testosterone levels. \n\nThe results showed a significant congruency
      effect across groups in the aPFC [ROI analysis: MNI coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ):
      (30, 58, 14) and (30 58 10);   p   = 0.001 and 0.036;   t   = 4.46 and 3.43;
      for further details, see  ]. As expected, this effect was driven by the healthy
      control group, and it was significantly weaker in the psychopathic offenders
      [  p   = 0.001 and 0.040;   t   = 4.58 and 3.40, on the congruency effect in
      healthy control subjects masked implicitly by group (HC > PP)  congruency interaction].
      The implicit masking demonstrates that the group  congruency interaction is
      also significant at   p   < 0.05 within the significant voxels corrected for
      multiple comparisons on the HC congruency effect. The psychopathy group showed
      no significant congruency effect in this region (  p   > 0.3). There was also
      a significant congruency effect across groups in the right superior parietal
      lobule (whole-brain analysis); this effect was driven mainly by the psychopathy
      group ( ). \n  \nClusters showing significantly larger activity for the affect-incongruent
      vs the affect-congruent conditions (emotion-control effect) \n    \nCritically,
      testosterone modulated the congruency effect in the aPFC differently in psychopathic
      offenders and healthy control subjects (whole-brain analysis on testosterone  group  congruency:
      MINI coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ): (30, 58, 12);   p   < 0.001;   t   =
      5.10; for all details, see  ).   Post hoc   analyses revealed that, in the psychopathy
      group, congruency effects decreased as testosterone levels increased [MNI coordinates
      (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ): (32, 56, 10) and (30, 58, 8);   p   = 0.002 and 0.015;   t   =
      4.34 and 3.74]. The modulatory effect of testosterone on congruency was absent
      in the healthy control subjects (  p    0.05;  ). The whole-brain analysis also
      showed an effect in the right caudate nucleus and right inferior supramarginal
      gyrus, driven by reduced congruency effects as a function of testosterone in
      the psychopathy group ( ;  ). \n  \nTestosterone modulations of the cerebral

      purposes. There are no outliers [Mahalanobis distances   D     < 4.2 (cutoff
      at   p   < 0.05;   D   = 7.74);  ;  ]. Healthy control subjects show an increased
      aPFC activity for the congruency effect and no modulation by testosterone, while
      in psychopathic offenders endogenous testosterone levels modulate the activity
      of the aPFC and right supramarginal gyrus. \n  \n\n#### Effective connectivity
      analyses \n  \nGiven the relevance of aPFCamygdala connectivity for implementing
      emotional control as evoked by the AA task ( ), we assessed whether psychopathy
      also resulted in altered connectivity along that neural pathway. Connectivity
      analyses using the right aPFC [4-mm-radius sphere; central voxel from main analysis
      (MNI coordinates:   x  , 30;   y  , 58;   z  , 14)] as the seed region on the
      congruency effect indicated a significant group difference (PP > HC) with the
      right amygdala ( ; ROI analysis; extent, 3 voxels;   t   = 3.82;   p   = 0.027;
      MNI coordinates of local maxima:   x  , 32;   y  , 0;   z  , 16). When testing
      effects for both groups separately, healthy control subjects showed a significant
      negative coupling between the right aPFC and amygdala (ROI analysis; extent:
      3 voxels,   t   = 3.70;   p   = 0.036; MNI coordinates of local maxima:   x  ,
      32;   y  , 0;   z  , 16), while psychopathic offenders showed no differential
      connectivity effect.   Post hoc   testing on right amygdala voxels showing the
      group interaction (threshold,   p   < 0.05 FWE) indicated a significant positive
      correlation with testosterone over both groups (ROI analysis; extent, 1 voxel;   t   =
      2.29;   p   = 0.029; MNI coordinates of local maxima:   x  , 32;   y  , 2;   z  ,
      16). There was no correlation between aPFCamygdala connectivity and the PCL-R
      scores (  p   > 0.2). \n  \nGroup difference on congruency-related aPFCamygdala

      control subjects, which is not present in the psychopathic offenders. \n  \n\n\n\n##
      Discussion \n  \nThis study indicates that psychopathic offenders show reduced
      aPFC activity as well as less aPFCamygdala connectivity during the control of
      emotional behavior. Emotional control was measured by comparing affect-incongruent
      and affect-congruent approachavoidance responses to emotional faces (congruency
      effect on the AA task;  ). When healthy control subjects exerted emotional control,
      reaction times, aPFC activity, and aPFCamygdala anticorrelations increased,
      confirming previous observations ( ). In contrast, psychopathic offenders did
      not show this typical control-related pattern of aPFC activity and connectivity.
      In addition, these effects were significantly modulated by endogenous testosterone.
      Namely, psychopathic individuals with relatively lower testosterone levels showed
      a neural activity and connectivity pattern that resembled the findings in healthy
      control subjects, while this pattern was absent in those with higher testosterone
      levels. This indicates that especially psychopathic individuals with high testosterone
      levels have less prefrontal regulation of amygdala-driven emotional actions
      when the control of emotional behavior is required. \n\n### Emotional control
      in psychopathy \n  \nImaging studies have illustrated an association between
      psychopathy and altered processing of fear, including altered amygdala responses
      ( ;  ;  ), attentional deficits for peripheral stimuli ( ), and moral/empathic
      insensitivity ( ;  ). However, psychopathic offenders also show clear impulsivity
      problems ( ), for example, when control is required during emotionally provoking
      situations. To address this relatively unexplored but crucial component of criminal
      psychopathy, we used a paradigm requiring rule-driven control of emotional actions.
      With this paradigm, it was possible to move beyond simple motor inhibition and
      to target the flexible control of emotionally driven action tendencies. \n\nFirst,
      the aPFC (also called BA 10) was less active in psychopathic offenders as a
      function of testosterone. The aPFC is a region crucial for the control of social
      emotional behavior. When aPFC functioning is temporarily disrupted, participants
      have increased difficulty in overriding emotional tendencies with rule-driven
      behavior ( ). Moreover, the aPFC seems especially important for integrating
      and coordinating multiple cognitive processes to facilitate response selection
      ( ;  ). For example, transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced reduction of
      aPFC functioning during the control of emotional behavior decreased activity
      in brain areas associated with rule selection (posterior parietal cortex), while
      both amygdala activity and automatic action tendencies increased ( ). The current
      study indicates that psychopathic individuals with especially high testosterone
      levels recruited the aPFC less when the control of emotional responses was needed.
      This finding suggests that they have reduced coordination of rule-based behavior
      with emotional information. \n\nSecond, connectivity between the aPFC and amygdala
      also differed significantly between groups. Healthy control subjects showed
      a negative aPFCamygdala coupling during the control of social emotional behavior,
      whereas psychopathic individuals showed no significant coupling between these
      regions. Evidence of anatomical connectivity alterations between these regions
      in psychopathic individuals and the relation of that tract to social emotional
      behavior modifications support these findings ( ). Although these results cannot
      resolve the direction of these connectivity effects, a previous study ( ) using
      this paradigm showed an effective connectivity modulation of emotional control
      on the connection from aPFC to amygdala. Also, animal studies ( ) suggest strong
      prefrontal inhibitory connections that control automatic amygdala responses.
      The absence of this aPFCamygdala coupling in psychopathic offenders suggests
      that in this group the aPFC has a reduced ability to inhibit amygdala-driven
      responses. This study used subtle emotional provocations, but stronger emotional
      events result in stronger amygdala responses, increasing the bias for automatic
      emotional behavior ( ). A lack of prefrontal control likely reduces the ability
      to inhibit these biases and lead to an increased expression of automatic emotional
      actions even when they are not beneficial ( ;  ). \n\nTestosterone administration
      studies also illustrated a decoupling between the prefrontal cortex and the
      amygdala, suggesting that testosterone reduces the communication between the
      PFC and amygdala ( ;  ;  ) and, within the AA task, reduces top-down control.
      The association between testosterone levels and enhanced social aggression and
      dominance seeking, and reduced impulse control in the general population ( ;  ;  )
      supports the relevance of testosterone in this process. Even amygdala responses
      to angry faces have recently been found to be enhanced after testosterone administration
      and in psychopathic individuals ( ;  ;  ). There is a clear association between
      testosterone and aggression after provocation, which has been related to reduced
      activity in the orbital frontal cortex, a region just ventral of the aPFC (
      ). Interestingly, psychopathic offenders with lower testosterone levels displayed
      a pattern similar to that in healthy control subjects, while the psychopathic
      individuals with high testosterone levels showed less aPFC activity and aPFCamygdala
      coupling. This could provide a potential vulnerability factor explaining the
      difference between the goal-directed successful psychopath and the unsuccessful
      psychopath with reduced impulse control ( ;  ). We hypothesize that especially
      psychopathic individuals with high testosterone levels fail to inhibit amygdala-driven
      action tendencies using the aPFC during the control of emotional behavior.\n
      \n\nEndogenous testosterone levels also modulated control-related activity in
      the supramarginal gyrus and caudate nucleus of the psychopathy group. The supramarginal
      gyrus was previously found to be involved during emotional control on the AA
      task in a healthy student sample ( ). Previous work indicated that it plays
      an important role in action organization ( ), and that psychopathic individuals
      show reduced supramarginal gyrus activity compared with control subjects when
      reasoning about other peoples emotional state ( ). The current findings, emphasizing
      the role of supramarginal gyrus during emotional control in psychopathic offenders
      with low testosterone levels, could indicate the facilitation of action preparation
      in trials with affect-incongruent stimulusresponse mapping. The caudate nucleus
      is important for incorporating predicted action outcome, when selecting the
      most beneficial behavioral goal ( ), and has previously found to be larger in
      psychopathy ( ). In light of these findings, our results suggest that psychopathic
      offenders with low endogenous testosterone levels, as opposed to those with
      high testosterone levels, have more interference of automatic action tendencies
      and outcomes associated with the facial emotions (e.g., approachhappy) that
      are opposite to the required actions during affect-incongruent trials ( ). \n\n\n###
      Interpretational issues \n  \nIndividuals with psychopathy have been suggested
      to have difficulty recognizing emotional expressions. However, this impairment
      seems quite specific to fear, rather than the emotional expressions used here
      (anger and happiness;  ;  ). Furthermore, the groups assessed in this study
      made comparable numbers of errors, suggesting that psychopathic offenders had
      no special difficulty in recognizing the clear emotional expressions used in
      this study. \n\nThis study used a relatively subtle manipulation to target the
      emotional control system. The rationale of this choice was to detect neural
      vulnerability markers without affecting behavioral performance. Psychopathic
      offenders performing a more salient behavioral version of the AA task showed
      reduced avoidance of angry faces ( ). In this study, angry faces evoked numerically
      similar behavioral effects ( ) and, additionally, aPFC effects (  post hoc   inspection
      of extracted parameters). Although these observations could be interpreted as
      a sign that psychopathic offenders have a tendency to approach angry faces,
      those observations were not statistically significant between groups [behavioral
      and aPFC group effects on angry faces:   p   > 0.2;   p   = 0.271;   z   = 2.54,
      on the angrycongruency effect in healthy control subjects masked implicitly
      by group (HC > PP)  angrycongruency interaction]. Future investigation is needed
      to directly test whether more provocative paradigms induce specific effects
      for angry faces. A previous study ( ) using this fMRI task in participants with
      genetic susceptibility for developing aggressive disorders, also found no group-specific
      behavioral effects. That study suggested that alterations of the aPFCamygdala
      pathway might reflect a vulnerability factor for psychopathologies. \n\nPreviously,
      endogenous testosterone modulated the aPFC and aPFCamygdala coupling in a sample
      of healthy students ( ). In that study, a different demographic group of healthy
      control subjects similarly showed a testosterone modulation of aPFCamygdala
      coupling, but no testosterone modulation of aPFC activity. This difference in
      the strength of testosterone-modulatory effects might be related to between-group
      differences in age (mean healthy control subjects, 41; mean students, 22;  ),
      educational level (staff of forensic psychiatric institute vs university students),
      or general anxiety [STAI trait, lower in healthy control subjects of the current
      study; mean (SD): 29 (4.4) and 34 (6.9), respectively;   t   = 2.605;   p   =
      0.014]. A limitation of this study is the modest sample size. Our focus to exclude
      moderating factors of comorbid disorders (except antisocial personality disorder)
      and recent drug use has the advantage that the sample is relatively homogeneous,
      but future studies using larger samples are needed for replication and to define
      subsamples. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nPsychopathic offenders showed reduced
      aPFC activity and aPFCamygdala connectivity during control of emotional actions,
      suggesting a decreased coordination of emotional information during rule-driven
      behavior. Moreover, endogenous testosterone modulated the involvement of these
      neural mechanisms. Psychopathic offenders with high testosterone levels showed
      less involvement of the aPFC, aPFCamygdala connectivity, supramarginal gyrus,
      and caudate nucleus, whereas psychopathic individuals with low testosterone
      levels recruited the aPFC in a fashion similar to that of healthy control subjects.
      These findings suggest that a lack of prefrontal control during emotional actions
      may explain enhanced impulsivity in psychopathic offenders during emotionally
      provoking situations. They outline a neuroendocrine model underlying impulsive
      emotional behavior in psychopathy and support the relevance of assessing a potential
      imbalance in testosterone function to guide treatment. It remains to be seen
      whether these neuroendocrine alterations of emotional control are also present
      in highly impulsive or antisocial individuals. \n\n\n \n\n Call the extractData
