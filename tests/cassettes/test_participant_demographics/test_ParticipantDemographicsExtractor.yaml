      criminals are commonly seen as instrumentally abusive and emotionally callous,
      yet social challenges often trigger uncontrolled emotional behavior in those
      individuals. This study shows how this paradoxical aspect of psychopathy relates
      to altered neuroendocrine interactions between testosterone and the cerebral
      circuit coordinating emotional action tendencies. The anterior prefrontal cortex,
      a region necessary for controlling emotional behavior, showed blunted responses
      and reduced connectivity with the amygdala in psychopathic criminals engaged
      in controlling their emotional action tendencies. This cerebral pattern was
      strongest in psychopathic individuals with high endogenous testosterone levels.
      This neuroendocrine signature of altered emotional control highlights the relevance
      of considering the testosterone level of individual psychopathic patients during
      treatment of their impulsive behavior. \\n\\n\\n## Introduction \\n  \\nPsychopathy
      is a disorder often associated with blunted emotional responding and increased
      goal-directed behavior ( ;  ). On the other hand, offenders with psychopathy
      also show a paradoxical increase in impulsive behavior and uncontrolled aggression
      after emotional provocations ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), which may be related to heightened
      testosterone levels ( ;  ). These two aspects of psychopathy are also distinguished
      within the most commonly used psychopathy checklist, the Psychopathy Check List-Revised
      (PCL-R), potentially reflecting differing traits among psychopathic individuals
      ( ;  ). Importantly, enhanced difficulty in controlling emotional impulses,
      a crucial component of criminal psychopathy associated with PCL-R factor 2,
      has been largely neglected by cognitive neuroscience. Yet, the clinical relevance
      of this cognitive trait is large: reduced behavioral control and increased impulsivity
      predict recidivism in psychopathic offenders ( ), and behavioral control in
      psychopathic offenders appears particularly fragile when dealing with emotionally
      relevant behavior ( ;  , chapter 7;  ). Accordingly, understanding the neurobiological
      systems underlying the altered control of social emotional behavior in psychopathic
      individuals is relevant for improving currently available interventions, which
      are plagued by low treatment response and high recidivism ( ). Here we study
      those neuroendocrine systems in a group of psychopathic offenders engaged in
      an experimental paradigm that requires rule-driven control of emotional behavior.
      \\n\\nPrevious investigations of psychopathy showed altered reactivity to emotional
      material in several brain regions that include the anterior part of the PFC
      (aPFC) and the amygdala ( ;  ;  ). Furthermore, individuals with psychopathy
      showed decreased functional and anatomical connectivity between the PFC and
      amygdala at rest ( ;  ), an indication that these brain regions might have a
      reduced ability to interact effectively. Studies in healthy participants have
      shown that this cerebral circuit is necessary for implementing the control of
      emotionally relevant actions ( ). Namely, aPFC downregulates neural processing
      in the amygdala during emotional control ( ), while high levels of endogenous
      testosterone reduce such control-related connectivity between aPFC and amygdala
      ( ). Those findings raise the possibility that aPFC\u2013amygdala connectivity
      is altered when psychopathic offenders need to control emotionally relevant
      actions, with high levels of endogenous testosterone exacerbating that altered
      connectivity. \\n\\nThis study tests these hypotheses by measuring brain activity
      with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 15 psychopathic criminals
      and 19 matched healthy control subjects dealing with a challenge to control
      their emotional behavior. The psychopathy sample was obtained by focused and
      comprehensive screening excluding confounds that are frequently associated with
      random criminal sampling (e.g., medication use, comorbidity). The social approach\u2013avoidance
      (AA) task was used to provide reliable indexes of control over social emotional
      behavior ( ;  ;  , ). Behaviorally, psychopathic participants previously showed
      altered AA behavior to explicitly approaching and avoiding emotional faces (
      ). Similar findings occurred after testosterone administration in healthy participants
      ( ). Interestingly, a more subtle version of the AA task has been shown to be
      sensitive to testosterone-related alterations and genetic variations in the
      aPFC\u2013amygdala pathway, while keeping behavior constant across experimental
      groups ( ), opening the way for isolating neural vulnerability factors ( ) in
      psychopathy. During this task, participants respond to affective faces (happy,
      angry) presented for a short time with approach and avoidance movements. Automatic
      emotional tendencies (approach\u2013happy and avoid\u2013angry faces; affect-congruent
      response conditions) need to be controlled during affect-incongruent response
      conditions in order to apply the counterintuitive action of approaching angry
      and avoiding happy faces ( ;  ). Healthy participants respond more slowly and
      rely more strongly on the aPFC when emotional control is required, operationalized
      by the differences evoked between affect-incongruent and affect-congruent trials
      ( ;  ). Accordingly, this study tests whether exerting control over emotionally
      relevant actions is reflected by reduced functionality of the aPFC\u2013amygdala
      circuit in psychopathic individuals, suggesting less prefrontal regulation of
      emotional actions. In addition, it sets out to test whether this alteration
      is intensified by high levels of endogenous testosterone. \\n  \\nThe emotional
      control AA task. The AA task involved the presentation of happy and angry faces,
      and the performance of approach and avoidance responses. During the AA task,
      the participants had to select their response according to the perceived emotion
      of the face. At the beginning of each block of 12 trials, the participants received
      instructions on whether to pull the joystick toward themselves (approach) or
      push it away (avoid) when seeing a face with a particular emotion. When viewing
      happy or angry faces, automatic stimulus\u2013response tendencies trigger corresponding
      approach or avoidance actions. These tendencies could be followed during the
      affect-congruent condition (approach\u2013happy, avoid\u2013angry). In contrast,
      when task instructions required participants to avoid happy faces or to approach
      angry faces, automatic tendencies needed to be controlled and overridden with
      the instructed response (affect-incongruent condition). Participants saw the
      faces and moved the joystick while lying in a MR scanner (top left corner of
      the table). Figure adapted from  ). \\n  \\n\\n## Materials and Methods \\n
      \ \\n### Participants \\n  \\nThe psychopathic group was recruited from in-patient
      populations of the Pompestichting and Oldenkotte, forensic psychiatric institutes
      (TBS-clinics) in the Netherlands. TBS-clinics are facilities for criminal offenders
      with a mental disorder treated on behalf of the state. \\n\\nSeventeen male
      psychopathic violent offenders (age range, 23-56 years) participated; all had
      received a diagnosis with a PCL-R score of \u226526, according to European standards
      ( ;  ;  ). PCL-R consensus scores were obtained by trained clinicians based
      on a structured PCL-R interview, clinical status, and history. After the independent
      scoring, the two raters compared their scores and came to the consensus score.
      When no consensus could be found, a third independent rater was included in
      the process. Dutch versions of the National Adult Reading Test and Edinburgh
      Handedness Inventory were used to assess IQ levels and right-handedness ( ;
      \ ). Twenty-one healthy male control subjects (HCs) matched for age, right-handedness,
      and IQ, without criminal records or history of psychiatric disorders, were recruited
      from staff of the clinics. All participants received oral and written information
      about the experiment and gave written informed consent according to guidelines
      of the local ethics committee (Commissie Mensengebonden Onderzoek region Arnhem-Nijmegen).
      Psychiatric exclusion criteria consisted of neurological, axis-I, and axis-II
      disorders, besides antisocial personality disorder for the psychopathic group.
      They were screened for these exclusion criteria by trained psychologists using
      Dutch versions of the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID;  ) and Mini-International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI;  ) for   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      of Mental Disorders  , 4th edition, disorders. All participants were asked about
      drug use and medical/neurological history to exclude the following: alcohol
      use of >3 units/day, cannabis, or other illicit drug use 1 week before, psychotropic
      medication other than oxazepam 5 d before, 1 unit of alcohol or oxazepam use
      within 24 h before the experiment; history of trauma capitis; visual and auditive
      disorder; and neurological disorder. Furthermore, general exclusion criteria
      for MRI experiments were applied. Two psychopathic patients (PPs) and two HCs
      were excluded from the analyses, due to incomplete scanning procedures (1 PP,
      1 HC) or too many errors on the task (>16%, representing the outlier with a
      \  z  -score >3). The final groups did not differ in age, IQ, and handedness
      (see  ). \\n  \\nDemographical data \\n    \\n\\n### Procedure \\n  \\nTwo test
      sessions took place. During the first session, right-handedness, IQ, MINI, and
      SCID were assessed. During the second session, participants completed several
      questionnaires upon arrival in the laboratory, including the State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory (STAI) to measure anxiety levels ( ). Next, they provided saliva for
      the testosterone measurement. Afterward, participants were positioned in the
      1.5 T MR scanner and familiarized with the task setup. Immediately after this,
      the fMRI session started with the AA task (duration, 30 min) followed by another
      task (not included in this report). After a short break outside the scanner,
      the anatomical scan (duration, 5 min) and an unrelated task were acquired in
      the side-by-side 3 T MR scanner. \\n\\n\\n### Experimental task \\n  \\nThe
      AA task consisted of 24 blocks (with 12 trials per block and a baseline period
      of 21-24 s) during which participants had to respond to visually presented faces
      either by pulling a joystick toward themselves (approach) or by pushing it away
      from themselves (avoid;  ). The participants had to categorize faces as happy,
      angry, and neutral (filler items), based on their affective expressions. During
      each block, two of the three affective expressions were presented as stimuli,
      because only two responses could be given to categorize the stimulus. This resulted
      in six different block types each used four times, representing the affect (happy\u2013angry,
      happy\u2013neutral, angry\u2013neutral) \xD7 movement (approach\u2013avoid)
      combinations. At the start of each block, participants received written instructions
      regarding the required response mapping. The affect \xD7 movement combinations
      were pseudorandomly and evenly distributed (with no affect combination repetition),
      and the combination of the first block was counterbalanced across participants.
      Within each block, affective expressions and gender types were pseudorandomly
      presented, avoiding three or more sequential presentations of the same expression/gender,
      and two presentations of the same facial model. Each face was presented for
      100 ms, preceded by a 300 ms blank screen, and followed by the participant\u2019s
      response, a blank screen, and by a pseudorandom intertrial interval (ITI; 1-3
      s). A baseline period of 21-24 s preceded each block. The faces were from 36
      models (18 male) obtained from several databases ( ;  ;  ; ), each showing all
      expressions. The pictures were in grayscale, matched for brightness and contrast
      values, and displayed against a black background. To exclude influence from
      hair and nonfacial contours, the faces were trimmed. Joystick displacements
      of >80% along the sagittal plane within 2 s from stimulus presentation were
      marked as valid responses. Invalid responses were signaled for 1 s with written
      feedback stating \u201Cyou did not move your joystick far enough.\u201D After
      moving the joystick, participants had to return to the starting position (defined
      as the central area extending 20% along the sagittal plane) before the end of
      the ITI. Otherwise, visual feedback indicated \u201Creturn the joystick to the
      starting position,\u201D and the ITI was repeated after participants returned
      the joystick. The training at the beginning consisted of six blocks; one block
      of eight trials for each of the six affect \xD7 movement combinations. Different
      visual stimuli were used during the training and scanning blocks. \\n\\n\\n###
      Materials and apparatus \\n  \\nThe fMR images were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI
      scanner (Avanto, Siemens Medical Systems) with an eight-channel head coil using
      a multiecho generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA)
      sequence [ ; repetition time (TR), 2.14 ms; five echo times (TEs), 9.4/21/33/44/56
      ms; 34 transversal slices; ascending acquisition; distance factor, 17%; effective
      voxel size, 3.3 \xD7 3.3 \xD7 3.5 mm; field of view (FOV), 212 mm]. High-resolution
      anatomical images were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner with a 32-channel head
      coil using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (TR, 2300 ms;
      TE, 3.03 ms; 192 sagittal slices; voxel size, 1.0 \xD7 1.0 \xD7 1.0 mm; FOV,
      256 mm). \\n\\nAn MR-compatible joystick (Fiber Optic Joystick, Current Designs;
      sampling rate, 550 Hz) was placed on participants\u2019 abdomens to ensure comfortable
      push-and-pull movements ( ). Participants wore MR-compatible headphones to reduce
      scanner noise (Commander XG MRI Audio System, Resonance Technologies). Stimuli
      were projected at the center of a screen, viewed via a mirror above the participant\u2019s
      head, with a visual angle of 4\xB0 \xD7 6\xB0 (width \xD7 height). Stimuli presentation
      and acquisition of joystick positions were controlled by a PC running Presentation
      version 13 ( ). \\n\\n\\n### Salivary measurements \\n  \\nParticipants filled
      two Salicaps (IBL) with saliva for testosterone measurement, which were stored
      at \u221225\xB0C. Testosterone concentration was measured using competitive
      chemiluminescence immunoassay with a sensitivity of 0.0025 ng/ml (IBL International,
      Tecan). Intra-assay and interassay coefficients are between 10% and 12%. To
      control variables influencing testosterone levels, participants were instructed
      to refrain from any food, cigarettes, and drinks (except water) for 1 h before
      the experiment. \\n\\n\\n### Behavioral analysis \\n  \\nBehavioral data was
      analyzed using MATLAB version 7.9 (MathWorks) and PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc.).
      First, to obtain a precise measure of movement onset [reaction time (RT)], the
      joystick movement for each trial was reconstructed using the joystick displacement
      measurements. Excluded trials showed a joystick movement in the wrong direction,
      an extreme RT (<150 or >1500 ms), peak velocity (<0.1 cm/s), or movement time
      (>400 ms); or an error rate of above chance level in a block (in that case,
      the whole block was excluded). RTs and testosterone levels were log transformed
      to obtain a normal distribution. Second, following previous studies ( ;  ),
      we conducted three-way repeated-measures ANOVA (ANCOVArm) on the mean RT and
      error rates, with factors group (PP, HC), movement (approach, avoid), and valence
      (happy, angry), including standardized testosterone and STAI state as covariate.
      A measure of anxiety (STAI) was included to account for the effects of psychopathy
      type (e.g., primary vs secondary); and the possible effects on emotional behavior,
      hormonal levels, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex functioning ( ;  ;  ; ). The
      \u03B1-level was set at   p   < 0.05. \\n\\n\\n### Functional MRI data \\n  \\n####
      Single-subject analyses \\n  \\nImaging data were preprocessed and analyzed
      using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping;  ). The first four volumes of each
      participant\u2019s dataset were discarded to allow for   T   equilibration.
      Given the multiecho GRAPPA MR sequence (Poser et al., 2006), head motion parameters
      were estimated on MR images with the shortest TE (9.4 ms), since these are least
      affected by possible artifacts. These motion correction parameters, estimated
      using a least-squares approach with six rigid body transformation parameters
      (translations, rotations), were applied to the five echo images collected for
      each excitation. After spatial realignment, the five echo images were combined
      into a single MR volume using an optimized echo weighting method (Poser et al.,
      2006). The time series for each voxel was temporally realigned to the first
      slice in time. The   T  -weighted image was spatially coregistered to the mean
      of the functional images. The fMRI time series were transformed and resampled
      at an isotropic voxel size of 2 mm into standard Montreal Neurological Institute
      (MNI) space by unified segmentation and normalization using the coregistered
      \  T  -weighted image ( ). The normalized functional images were spatially smoothed
      using an isotropic 8 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. \\n\\nThe
      fMRI time series of each subject were further analyzed using an event-related
      approach in the context of general linear model, including the following effects:
      approach\u2013happy, approach\u2013neutral, approach\u2013angry, avoid\u2013happy,
      avoid\u2013neutral, and avoid\u2013angry. Trials excluded from behavioral analyses
      and periods of instructions or feedback were modeled as regressors. Vectors
      describing the time of picture presentation (onset) and RT of each event (duration)
      were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Potential confounding
      effects of residual head movement were modeled using original, squared, cubic,
      first-order, and second-order derivatives of the movement correction parameters
      ( ). Three further regressors, describing the time course of signal intensities
      of white matter, CSF, and the portion of the MR image outside the skull were
      also added. This procedure accounts for image intensity shifts due to hand movements
      within or near the magnetic field of the scanner ( ). Finally, fMRI time series
      were high-pass filtered (cutoff 120 s). Temporal autocorrelation was modeled
      as a first-order autoregressive process. \\n\\n\\n#### Group analyses \\n  \\nConsistent
      effects across participants and between groups were tested using a random-effects
      multiple regression analysis that included six contrast images (approach\u2013happy,
      approach\u2013neutral, approach\u2013angry, avoid\u2013happy, avoid\u2013neutral,
      avoid\u2013angry) per participant. Together, these images represented the estimated
      cerebral effects from 12 conditions of the experimental design [group (PP, HC)
      \xD7 valence (happy, neutral, angry) \xD7 response (approach, avoid)]. Standardized
      log-transformed testosterone and standardized STAI state levels were included
      in the multiple regression analysis as condition-specific [group (PP, HC) \xD7
      valence (happy, neutral, angry) \xD7 response (approach, avoid)] regressors,
      generating another 12 regressors per variable. \\n\\nAll analyses assessed the
      congruency effect, reflecting task-related differences of affect-incongruent
      (approach\u2013angry, avoid\u2013happy) versus affect-congruent trials (approach\u2013happy,
      avoid\u2013angry;  ;  ). We considered two effects. First, to test for general
      effects of congruency, we performed an analysis on the congruency effect over
      both groups and for each group separately. When assessing the effects of one
      group explicitly, we also tested whether those effects were specific to that
      group and were significantly weaker in the other group (at   p   < 0.05 uncorrected)
      by masking the statistical map describing the congruency effect in the first
      group (using multiple comparisons correction, see below) with the statistical
      map describing the group \xD7 congruency contrast. Second, to test whether testosterone
      differentially modulated the control of emotionally relevant actions in the
      groups, we performed a group \xD7 congruency contrast on the regressor parametrizing
      interindividual differences in testosterone on task-related conditions. If such
      an interaction is present, the testosterone modulation on the congruency effect
      of each group separately is considered. In addition to whole-brain analyses,
      we used a volume of interest (VOI) on coordinates previously found to be modulated
      by testosterone during the congruency effect in healthy students (two 8-mm-radius
      spheres centered on the following MNI coordinates:   x  , \u221230;   y  , 58;
      and z, 2; and   x  , 32;   y  , 54; and   z  , 8;  ). \\n\\nThe reported activations
      are corrected for multiple comparisons using familywise error (FWE) correction.
      For whole-brain analyses, we made inferences at cluster level (FWE:   p   <
      0.05, corresponding to a cluster size of >140 on the basis of intensity threshold,
      \  p   < 0.001). For VOI analyses, we made inferences at voxel-level (FWE corrected,
      \  p   < 0.05;  ;  ). Anatomical inference is drawn by superimposing SPM showing
      significant signal changes on structural images of participants. For anatomical
      accuracy, we report only activation peaks in gray matter. Anatomical landmarks
      were identified using the atlas of  . Brodmann areas (BAs) were assigned by
      superimposing significant SPM on the SPM anatomy toolbox ( ) and MRIcron template
      ( /). \\n\\n\\n\\n### Connectivity analyses \\n  \\nThe aim of the following
      analysis was to test whether inter-regional coupling of the aPFC (see Results)
      with the amygdala and other brain regions during the congruency effect was different
      between the groups and modulated by testosterone. To test for these effects,
      we used the psychophysiological interactions (PPIs) method ( ). More specifically,
      we tested for significant differences between the regression coefficients of
      each voxel over the right aPFC during the affect-incongruent versus the affect-congruent
      conditions. To select voxels to be included in the VOI, we used the following
      anatomical constraints ( ): for each participant, selected voxels fell within
      a sphere with a radius of 4 mm around the peak voxel corresponding to the activated
      cluster of the congruency effect over both groups (coordinates:   x  , 30;   y
      \ , 58;   z  , 14; see Results). Participant specific contrast images were generated
      describing the PPI between the time courses of the right aPFC VOI and affect-incongruent
      versus affect-congruent conditions. Group differences and testosterone modulations
      on task-related coupling between the aPFC and other regions were then assessed
      using a multiple regression design on participant-specific contrast images with
      their corresponding testosterone (log-transformed, standardized) and STAI state
      (standardized) levels as subject- and group-specific regressors. In addition
      to whole-brain analyses, we assessed significant voxel-level effects (FWE corrected
      for multiple comparisons,   p   < 0.05) within the amygdala, defined on the
      Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas ( ) using the WFU PickAtlas tool ( ). \\n\\n\\n\\n##
      Results \\n  \\n### Behavioral results \\n  \\nFifteen psychopathic criminals
      (PPs; PCL-R score of \u226526, according to European standards ( ;  ;  ) and
      19 HCs (for demographics, see  ) were included in the analyses. Participants
      performed the task accurately and consistently (error rates: PPs, 7.9%; HCs,
      7.3%; omissions: PPs, 1.6%; HCs, 1.5%; undefined responses: PPs, 0.9%; HCs,
      0.3%;  ). \\n  \\nRTs and error rates for each group and factor of the AA task
      \\n    \\nA significant movement \xD7 valence interaction for the RTs indicated
      that, over groups, participants responded more slowly during affect-incongruent
      (approach\u2013angry, avoid\u2013happy) than during affect-congruent trials
      (approach\u2013happy, avoid\u2013angry;   F   = 10.4,   p   = 0.003;  ). This
      congruency effect replicates the behavioral results from previous fMRI studies
      ( ;  ). Furthermore, there were main effects of movement (  F   = 26.3,   p
      \  < 0.001) and valence (  F   = 28.7,   p   < 0.001), reflecting the slowing
      of avoidance movements and responses to angry faces in general ( ). There were
      no significant effects involving group, including no main effect (  p   > 0.3).
      The congruency effect correlated positively (without corrections for multiple
      comparisons) with the PCL-R total score (  p   = 0.048,   R   = 0.517, respectively).
      Excluding anxiety from the analyses did not affect the outcomes. Moreover, when
      including the neutral conditions in the analyses, the movement \xD7 valence
      (happy, neutral, angry) interaction for RTs remained significant (  F   = 5.5,
      \  p   = 0.010), showing that neutral approach\u2013avoidance effects are intermediary
      compared with happy and angry ( ). \\n  \\nBehavioral results. Mean RTs (\xB1SEM)
      for the affect-congruent and affect-incongruent conditions of the AA task for
      the healthy control subjects and psychopathic offenders. The groups were significantly
      slower to provide affect-incongruent responses (approach\u2013angry; avoid\u2013happy)
      than affect-congruent responses (approach\u2013happy; avoid\u2013angry), with
      no significant group differences. \\n  \\nFor the error rates, the three-way
      ANCOVArm showed main effects of movement (  F   = 27.5,   p   < 0.001), valence
      (  F   = 25.9,   p   < 0.001), and testosterone (  F   = 4.6,   p   = 0.040),
      and a valence \xD7 testosterone interaction (  F   = 4.3,   p   = 0.047). There
      were no other significant effects for the error rates (  p   > 0.15). \\n\\nEndogenous

      did not differ between groups (  p   > 0.4), and showed no correlations with
      psychopathy (PCL-R) scores or with each other (  p   > 0.1). \\n\\n\\n### fMRI
      results \\n  \\n#### Multiple regression analyses \\n  \\nTo assess the two
      main questions of this study, we isolated cerebral structures showing stronger
      responses during affect-incongruent than affect-congruent trials (congruency
      effect), and cerebral structures in which the congruency effect was modulated
      by testosterone levels. \\n\\nThe results showed a significant congruency effect
      across groups in the aPFC [ROI analysis: MNI coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z
      \ ): (30, 58, 14) and (\u221230 58 10);   p   = 0.001 and 0.036;   t   = 4.46
      and 3.43; for further details, see  ]. As expected, this effect was driven by
      the healthy control group, and it was significantly weaker in the psychopathic
      offenders [  p   = 0.001 and 0.040;   t   = 4.58 and 3.40, on the congruency
      effect in healthy control subjects masked implicitly by group (HC > PP) \xD7
      congruency interaction]. The implicit masking demonstrates that the group \xD7
      congruency interaction is also significant at   p   < 0.05 within the significant
      voxels corrected for multiple comparisons on the HC congruency effect. The psychopathy
      group showed no significant congruency effect in this region (  p   > 0.3).
      There was also a significant congruency effect across groups in the right superior
      parietal lobule (whole-brain analysis); this effect was driven mainly by the
      psychopathy group ( ). \\n  \\nClusters showing significantly larger activity
      for the affect-incongruent vs the affect-congruent conditions (emotion-control
      effect) \\n    \\nCritically, testosterone modulated the congruency effect in
      the aPFC differently in psychopathic offenders and healthy control subjects
      (whole-brain analysis on testosterone \xD7 group \xD7 congruency: MINI coordinates
      (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ): (30, 58, 12);   p   < 0.001;   t   = 5.10; for all details,
      see  ).   Post hoc   analyses revealed that, in the psychopathy group, congruency
      effects decreased as testosterone levels increased [MNI coordinates (  x  ,
      \  y  ,   z  ): (32, 56, 10) and (\u221230, 58, 8);   p   = 0.002 and 0.015;
      \  t   = 4.34 and 3.74]. The modulatory effect of testosterone on congruency
      was absent in the healthy control subjects (  p   \u2265 0.05;  ). The whole-brain
      analysis also showed an effect in the right caudate nucleus and right inferior
      supramarginal gyrus, driven by reduced congruency effects as a function of testosterone
      in the psychopathy group ( ;  ). \\n  \\nTestosterone modulations of the cerebral

      There are no outliers [Mahalanobis distances   D     < 4.2 (cutoff at   p   <

      activity for the congruency effect and no modulation by testosterone, while
      in psychopathic offenders endogenous testosterone levels modulate the activity
      of the aPFC and right supramarginal gyrus. \\n  \\n\\n#### Effective connectivity
      analyses \\n  \\nGiven the relevance of aPFC\u2013amygdala connectivity for
      implementing emotional control as evoked by the AA task ( ), we assessed whether
      psychopathy also resulted in altered connectivity along that neural pathway.
      Connectivity analyses using the right aPFC [4-mm-radius sphere; central voxel
      from main analysis (MNI coordinates:   x  , 30;   y  , 58;   z  , 14)] as the
      seed region on the congruency effect indicated a significant group difference
      (PP > HC) with the right amygdala ( ; ROI analysis; extent, 3 voxels;   t   =
      3.82;   p   = 0.027; MNI coordinates of local maxima:   x  , 32;   y  , 0;   z
      \ , \u221216). When testing effects for both groups separately, healthy control
      subjects showed a significant negative coupling between the right aPFC and amygdala
      (ROI analysis; extent: 3 voxels,   t   = 3.70;   p   = 0.036; MNI coordinates
      of local maxima:   x  , 32;   y  , 0;   z  , \u221216), while psychopathic offenders
      showed no differential connectivity effect.   Post hoc   testing on right amygdala
      voxels showing the group interaction (threshold,   p   < 0.05 FWE) indicated
      a significant positive correlation with testosterone over both groups (ROI analysis;
      extent, 1 voxel;   t   = 2.29;   p   = 0.029; MNI coordinates of local maxima:
      \  x  , 32;   y  , 2;   z  , \u221216). There was no correlation between aPFC\u2013amygdala
      connectivity and the PCL-R scores (  p   > 0.2). \\n  \\nGroup difference on

      coupling in the healthy control subjects, which is not present in the psychopathic
      offenders. \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n## Discussion \\n  \\nThis study indicates that
      psychopathic offenders show reduced aPFC activity as well as less aPFC\u2013amygdala
      connectivity during the control of emotional behavior. Emotional control was
      measured by comparing affect-incongruent and affect-congruent approach\u2013avoidance
      responses to emotional faces (congruency effect on the AA task;  ). When healthy
      control subjects exerted emotional control, reaction times, aPFC activity, and
      aPFC\u2013amygdala anticorrelations increased, confirming previous observations
      ( ). In contrast, psychopathic offenders did not show this typical control-related
      pattern of aPFC activity and connectivity. In addition, these effects were significantly
      modulated by endogenous testosterone. Namely, psychopathic individuals with
      relatively lower testosterone levels showed a neural activity and connectivity
      pattern that resembled the findings in healthy control subjects, while this
      pattern was absent in those with higher testosterone levels. This indicates
      that especially psychopathic individuals with high testosterone levels have
      less prefrontal regulation of amygdala-driven emotional actions when the control
      of emotional behavior is required. \\n\\n### Emotional control in psychopathy
      \\n  \\nImaging studies have illustrated an association between psychopathy
      and altered processing of fear, including altered amygdala responses ( ;  ;
      \ ), attentional deficits for peripheral stimuli ( ), and moral/empathic insensitivity
      ( ;  ). However, psychopathic offenders also show clear impulsivity problems
      ( ), for example, when control is required during emotionally provoking situations.
      To address this relatively unexplored but crucial component of criminal psychopathy,
      we used a paradigm requiring rule-driven control of emotional actions. With
      this paradigm, it was possible to move beyond simple motor inhibition and to
      target the flexible control of emotionally driven action tendencies. \\n\\nFirst,
      the aPFC (also called BA 10) was less active in psychopathic offenders as a
      function of testosterone. The aPFC is a region crucial for the control of social
      emotional behavior. When aPFC functioning is temporarily disrupted, participants
      have increased difficulty in overriding emotional tendencies with rule-driven
      behavior ( ). Moreover, the aPFC seems especially important for integrating
      and coordinating multiple cognitive processes to facilitate response selection
      ( ;  ). For example, transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced reduction of
      aPFC functioning during the control of emotional behavior decreased activity
      in brain areas associated with rule selection (posterior parietal cortex), while
      both amygdala activity and automatic action tendencies increased ( ). The current
      study indicates that psychopathic individuals with especially high testosterone
      levels recruited the aPFC less when the control of emotional responses was needed.
      This finding suggests that they have reduced coordination of rule-based behavior
      with emotional information. \\n\\nSecond, connectivity between the aPFC and
      amygdala also differed significantly between groups. Healthy control subjects
      showed a negative aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling during the control of social emotional
      behavior, whereas psychopathic individuals showed no significant coupling between
      these regions. Evidence of anatomical connectivity alterations between these
      regions in psychopathic individuals and the relation of that tract to social
      emotional behavior modifications support these findings ( ). Although these
      results cannot resolve the direction of these connectivity effects, a previous
      study ( ) using this paradigm showed an effective connectivity modulation of
      emotional control on the connection from aPFC to amygdala. Also, animal studies
      ( ) suggest strong prefrontal inhibitory connections that control automatic
      amygdala responses. The absence of this aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling in psychopathic
      offenders suggests that in this group the aPFC has a reduced ability to inhibit
      amygdala-driven responses. This study used subtle emotional provocations, but
      stronger emotional events result in stronger amygdala responses, increasing
      the bias for automatic emotional behavior ( ). A lack of prefrontal control
      likely reduces the ability to inhibit these biases and lead to an increased
      expression of automatic emotional actions even when they are not beneficial
      ( ;  ). \\n\\nTestosterone administration studies also illustrated a decoupling
      between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, suggesting that testosterone
      reduces the communication between the PFC and amygdala ( ;  ;  ) and, within
      the AA task, reduces top-down control. The association between testosterone
      levels and enhanced social aggression and dominance seeking, and reduced impulse
      control in the general population ( ;  ;  ) supports the relevance of testosterone
      in this process. Even amygdala responses to angry faces have recently been found
      to be enhanced after testosterone administration and in psychopathic individuals
      ( ;  ;  ). There is a clear association between testosterone and aggression
      after provocation, which has been related to reduced activity in the orbital
      frontal cortex, a region just ventral of the aPFC ( ). Interestingly, psychopathic
      offenders with lower testosterone levels displayed a pattern similar to that
      in healthy control subjects, while the psychopathic individuals with high testosterone
      levels showed less aPFC activity and aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling. This could
      provide a potential vulnerability factor explaining the difference between the
      goal-directed \u201Csuccessful\u201D psychopath and the \u201Cunsuccessful\u201D
      psychopath with reduced impulse control ( ;  ). We hypothesize that especially
      psychopathic individuals with high testosterone levels fail to inhibit amygdala-driven
      action tendencies using the aPFC during the control of emotional behavior.\\n
      \\n\\nEndogenous testosterone levels also modulated control-related activity
      in the supramarginal gyrus and caudate nucleus of the psychopathy group. The
      supramarginal gyrus was previously found to be involved during emotional control
      on the AA task in a healthy student sample ( ). Previous work indicated that
      it plays an important role in action organization ( ), and that psychopathic
      individuals show reduced supramarginal gyrus activity compared with control
      subjects when reasoning about other people\u2019s emotional state ( ). The current
      findings, emphasizing the role of supramarginal gyrus during emotional control
      in psychopathic offenders with low testosterone levels, could indicate the facilitation
      of action preparation in trials with affect-incongruent stimulus\u2013response
      mapping. The caudate nucleus is important for incorporating predicted action
      outcome, when selecting the most beneficial behavioral goal ( ), and has previously
      found to be larger in psychopathy ( ). In light of these findings, our results
      suggest that psychopathic offenders with low endogenous testosterone levels,
      as opposed to those with high testosterone levels, have more interference of
      automatic action tendencies and outcomes associated with the facial emotions
      (e.g., approach\u2013happy) that are opposite to the required actions during
      affect-incongruent trials ( ). \\n\\n\\n### Interpretational issues \\n  \\nIndividuals
      with psychopathy have been suggested to have difficulty recognizing emotional
      expressions. However, this impairment seems quite specific to fear, rather than
      the emotional expressions used here (anger and happiness;  ;  ). Furthermore,
      the groups assessed in this study made comparable numbers of errors, suggesting
      that psychopathic offenders had no special difficulty in recognizing the clear
      emotional expressions used in this study. \\n\\nThis study used a relatively
      subtle manipulation to target the emotional control system. The rationale of
      this choice was to detect neural vulnerability markers without affecting behavioral
      performance. Psychopathic offenders performing a more salient behavioral version
      of the AA task showed reduced avoidance of angry faces ( ). In this study, angry
      faces evoked numerically similar behavioral effects ( ) and, additionally, aPFC
      effects (  post hoc   inspection of extracted parameters). Although these observations
      could be interpreted as a sign that psychopathic offenders have a tendency to
      approach angry faces, those observations were not statistically significant
      between groups [behavioral and aPFC group effects on angry faces:   p   > 0.2;
      \  p   = 0.271;   z   = 2.54, on the angry\u2013congruency effect in healthy
      control subjects masked implicitly by group (HC > PP) \xD7 angry\u2013congruency
      interaction]. Future investigation is needed to directly test whether more provocative
      paradigms induce specific effects for angry faces. A previous study ( ) using
      this fMRI task in participants with genetic susceptibility for developing aggressive
      disorders, also found no group-specific behavioral effects. That study suggested
      that alterations of the aPFC\u2013amygdala pathway might reflect a vulnerability
      factor for psychopathologies. \\n\\nPreviously, endogenous testosterone modulated
      the aPFC and aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling in a sample of healthy students ( ).
      In that study, a different demographic group of healthy control subjects similarly
      showed a testosterone modulation of aPFC\u2013amygdala coupling, but no testosterone
      modulation of aPFC activity. This difference in the strength of testosterone-modulatory
      effects might be related to between-group differences in age (mean healthy control
      subjects, 41; mean students, 22;  ), educational level (staff of forensic psychiatric
      institute vs university students), or general anxiety [STAI trait, lower in
      healthy control subjects of the current study; mean (SD): 29 (4.4) and 34 (6.9),
      respectively;   t   = \u22122.605;   p   = 0.014]. A limitation of this study
      is the modest sample size. Our focus to exclude moderating factors of comorbid
      disorders (except antisocial personality disorder) and recent drug use has the
      advantage that the sample is relatively homogeneous, but future studies using
      larger samples are needed for replication and to define subsamples. \\n\\n\\n###
      Conclusion \\n  \\nPsychopathic offenders showed reduced aPFC activity and aPFC\u2013amygdala
      connectivity during control of emotional actions, suggesting a decreased coordination
      of emotional information during rule-driven behavior. Moreover, endogenous testosterone
      modulated the involvement of these neural mechanisms. Psychopathic offenders
      with high testosterone levels showed less involvement of the aPFC, aPFC\u2013amygdala
      connectivity, supramarginal gyrus, and caudate nucleus, whereas psychopathic
      individuals with low testosterone levels recruited the aPFC in a fashion similar
      to that of healthy control subjects. These findings suggest that a lack of prefrontal
      control during emotional actions may explain enhanced impulsivity in psychopathic
      offenders during emotionally provoking situations. They outline a neuroendocrine
      model underlying impulsive emotional behavior in psychopathy and support the
      relevance of assessing a potential imbalance in testosterone function to guide
      treatment. It remains to be seen whether these neuroendocrine alterations of
      emotional control are also present in highly impulsive or antisocial individuals.

      school seniors reporting recent use and 6.5% of 12th graders being daily users
      ( ), marijuana (MJ) is the most frequently used illicit substance among adolescents.
      Across all age groups over 70% of new drug initiates start with using MJ at
      an average age of 18 years ( ). Indeed, the scope of MJ use prevalence is of
      great public interest, as MJ use in early adolescence is associated with increased
      risk of greater substance use, legal problems, disrupting education, injuries/medical
      problems, developing psychopathology, cognitive changes and chronic psychosocial
      struggles ( ,  ,  ,  ). Taken together, rates of MJ use are suggestive of an
      epidemic based in adolescence, which is concerning not just due to societal
      cost, but also due to the potential to offset sensitive brain development during
      this period. \\n\\nDespite its prevalence, the impact of MJ use on adolescent
      brain development is not fully known. Important neuromaturational processes
      during adolescence through young adulthood are believed to bring about improved
      higher-order cognition by refining neural systems locally and globally through
      white and gray matter development ( ,  ,  ). In general, gray matter reductions
      and cortical thinning coincide with increased white matter volume and organization
      through adolescence and young adulthood, suggestive of synaptic pruning and
      axonal myelination ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The endogenous cannabinoid (CB) system is
      also immature during adolescence ( ,  ). In an animal model ( ) imaged CB1 receptor
      binding using PET and found relatively lower activation of CB1 receptors in
      adolescent rats compared to adult rats in brain areas including those in the
      frontal cortex, temporal lobe (hippocampus and amygdala) and sub-cortical regions
      including striatal regions, thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus. Thus,
      adolescence represents a developmental period with vulnerability to structural
      and functional changes due to exogenous MJ exposure. \\n\\nAdolescent MJ use
      has the potential to cause structural and functional changes in the brain by
      altering cannabinoid signaling. One possible mechanism would be blunt neurotoxic
      influence. For example, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive
      component in MJ that binds CB1 receptors, is reported to cause cell shrinkage
      and damage DNA strands in THC-treated neuron cultures ( ). This may be the mechanism
      by which smaller volumes have been observed in individuals exposed to cannabis
      during adolescence ( ). However, it is more likely that MJ exerts its influence
      on brain development indirectly. The cannabinoid system plays a role in modulating
      other neurotransmitters, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate
      and monoamines ( ). Specifically, activation of CB1 receptors is associated
      with down-regulating inhibitory GABAergic transmission in cortical interneurons
      during adolescence ( ,  ). In addition, CB signaling inhibits microglia function
      ( ). These two points are important because cortical pruning processes involve
      glial-mediated synaptic elimination and altering the excitatory/inhibitory balance
      is liable to disrupt the selective tagging and preserving synapses ( ). The
      impact of this indirect influence on the developing brain may be in the observations
      of abnormal connectivity in those who began MJ use in adolescence ( ). Evidence
      from human neuroimaging studies lends greater support to MJ-related disruptions
      to brain development. \\n\\nStructural neuroimaging studies have indicated that
      volumes of several brain areas are smaller in heavy adult MJ users especially
      in areas enriched with cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors, such as medial temporal
      lobe, and prefrontal cortex ( ). Studies of adult chronic MJ users note brain
      volume reductions in temporal lobe, insula, and prefrontal cortex, amygdala
      and hippocampus ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Among different characteristics of MJ involvement
      (e.g., dependence symptoms, use frequency, consumption), the age of initial
      MJ use is a robust factor that has been associated with smaller brain volumes
      in users. For example,   observed left parahippocampal gyrus and right temporal
      pole structural differences in 25 regular MJ users compared to 22 occasional
      users, however, even the occasional users who began smoking MJ during adolescence
      (before age 18) demonstrated similar brain changes as the regular users. Our
      group has also found links with early MJ use onset ( ) and structural connectivity
      with orbitofrontal cortex in a cohort of daily MJ users, suggesting complex
      neuroadaptive processes related to MJ use in the context of adolescent brain
      development ( ). These findings underscore the potential for significant heterogeneity
      in brain changes among adult MJ users, especially those who began using MJ during
      neurodevelopment. \\n\\nStudies comparing early adolescent MJ use to users initiating
      MJ use in later adolescence provide further evidence for the potential of MJ
      to cause enduring change. The few studies that have directly investigated the
      timing of the effects of MJ during adolescence have noted divergent neurodevelopment
      effects. For example, in an fMRI study by Gruber and colleagues, functional
      and behavioral differences during an interference task were reported between
      early (before age 16) and late (after age 16) MJ users ( ) ( ). The same group
      also reported decreased white matter integrity in early onset vs. late onset
      MJ users (mean age 14.46 vs. 17.93) ( ). Similar differential effects have also
      been noted in parietal lobe activation between early and late adolescent binge
      drinkers during a spatial working memory task ( ). These studies highlight the
      importance of clarifying the differential neural effects of early- and late-adolescent
      onset use. \\n\\nTo that end, in the current study, we compared daily MJ users
      who were early onset users (<16 years old) versus late onset users (\u226516
      years old) on measures of cortical morphology that are sensitive to developmental
      changes. We aimed to characterize both the effect of early onset status on cortical
      morphology as well as assess for morphological patterns linked to the continued
      use of MJ after early and late adolescent MJ initiation. We expected early onset
      users to show a morphological pattern consistent with disruption of early adolescent
      brain development (e.g., increased cortical thickness, greater gray/white definition
      of the cortical ribbon via disruptions to adolescent pruning processes) that
      may be more consistent with indirect impact of MJ of brain development. While
      gray matter decline has been shown to be associated with marijuana use, particularly
      in areas rich in CB1 receptors, increased cortical thickness and greater gray/white
      definition in the cortical ribbon point to potential disruption in neurodevelopment
      (i.e. synaptic pruning) that may result from MJ use at key developmental stages
      (i.e. earlier as opposed to later in adolescent neuronal development). Such
      disruptions may extend to gyrification as well. While this process begins in
      utero, there is evidence that gyrification is ongoing into adolescence ( ,  ,
      \ ) and may also display aberrant developmental patterns in the presence of
      MJ use. \\n\\n\\n## Methods \\n  \\nThis study was approved by the University
      of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
      (UTSW) Institutional Review Boards. All participants were recruited from the
      Dallas-Ft.Worth metro area via flyers and advertisements. Following informed
      consent, MJ users completed two sessions \u2013 a baseline appointment for collecting
      demographic, psychosocial and behavioral measures and a thorough substance use
      history. Three days later the participants returned for a neuroimaging appointment.
      Prior to their scanning session, participants were asked to be abstinent from
      MJ use for 72\_h, from alcohol for 24\_h, and from caffeine and cigarettes for
      the preceding 2\_h. These were confirmed by self-report (MJ, alcohol, caffeine
      and cigarettes), quantitative THC urinalysis (MJ), and by breath alcohol level
      of .000 (alcohol) at the start of their session. \\n\\n### Participants \\n
      \ \\nWe scanned 45 regular heavy MJ users as part of the parent project. Inclusion
      criteria were: right-handedness, English as the primary language and no histories
      of psychosis, traumatic brain injury, and MRI contraindications (e.g., pregnancy,
      non-removal metallic implants, claustrophobia). One subject reported a history
      of anxiety and depression and one other reported a history of ADHD as a child.
      Additional exclusions for the current study included: Axis I diagnosis (via
      SCID) other than cannabis use disorder, unusable sMRI due to motion artifact
      or poor signal-to-noise ratio that precluded accurate tissue segmentation (
      \ n  \_=\_1) and incomplete drug use histories (  n  \_=\_2). Of the 42 remaining
      cases, 22 were early onset users (onset of first use before age 16). Group categorization
      using onset of regular use as opposed to onset of first use maintained the same
      grouping (mean early onset of regular use\_=\_16.5, mean late onset of regular
      use\_=\_19.0). Regular use was defined as at least one time per week. To determine
      how age of onset of regular MJ use influenced our reported effects, we performed
      these analyses while covarying for age of onset of regular use (see  ).   summarizes
      demographic and substance use information according to onset status.   summarizes
      the correlation between age and identified marijuana use variables. Only MJ
      years of use and current age showed a statistically significant correlation.
      Participants were recruited based on self-reported daily MJ use and a positive
      urinalysis for THC metabolites at their baseline visit. All of the participants
      were screened via urinalysis for other drugs of abuse and were excluded if drugs
      (other than MJ) were detected. Participants were required to have used MJ for
      a minimum of 5000 lifetime occasions and self-report daily use (without >24\_h
      abstinence) for the last 60 days.   \\nSample characteristics. MJ, marijuana.

      \\n  \\nScanning sessions took place at the Advanced Imaging Research Center
      at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center three days following
      their initial visit. Another verification of THC metabolites via urinalysis
      was also performed before the scan. MRI images were collected using a 3T Philips
      whole-body scanner equipped with Quasar gradient subsystem (40\_mT/m amplitude,
      a slew rate of 220\_mT/m/ms). High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical scans were
      collected using a MPRAGE sequence: TR/TE/TI\_=\_2100/3.70/1100\_ms; flip angle\_=\_12\xB0;
      field of view\_=\_256\_mm\_\xD7\_256\_mm; slab thickness\_=\_160\_mm (along
      left-right direction); voxel size\_=\_1\_mm\_\xD7\_1\_mm\_\xD7\_1\_mm, Total
      scan time\_=\_3\_m 57\_s. \\n\\n\\n#### Image processing \\n  \\nMPRAGE anatomical
      scans were pre-processed for surface-based analyses using FreeSurfer v5.3 semi-automated
      pipeline ( ). This semi-automated pipeline included spatial (Talairach) and
      signal intensity normalization of images, volumetric segmentation and subcortical
      labeling ( ,  ). Outer gray matter and white matter boundaries were then identified
      and reconstructed into a mesh of over 150,000 tessellated vertices to allow
      point-to-point surface measures ( ). Next, gyral anatomy is aligned to a standard
      spherical template using surface convexity and curvature measures. Resulting
      surfaces were inspected, blind to MJ onset status, to identify and correct any
      errors made during cortical reconstruction. Modifications to the volumes were
      made as necessary to correct for tissue misclassifications according to FreeSurfer's
      wiki manual ( ). In preparation for analysis, each morphological measure for
      each case was co-registered to a standard template (fsaverage). Anatomical labels
      in FreeSurfer ( ) were used for interpretation of results. \\n\\n\\n\\n### Morphological
      measures \\n  \\n#### Cortical thickness \\n  \\nThe width of the cortical ribbon
      was measured as the distance between corresponding vertices of the white matter
      and gray matter surfaces at each vertex in the cortical mantel ( ). \\n\\n\\n####
      Gray\u2013white matter ratio (GWR) \\n  \\nTo assess the quality of cortical
      ribbon definition, a tissue contrast between gray and white matter signal intensities
      was computed as a percent ratio (W\_\u2212\_G)/(.5*(W\_+\_G)) (from pctsurfcon
      v1.11.2.1, inbuilt component of FreeSurfer pipeline v5.3, 2011). White matter
      signal intensities were measured at an absolute length of 1\_mm below the gray\u2013white
      border surface and gray matter signal was measured 30% into the cortical ribbon
      ( ). \\n\\n\\n#### Local gyrification index \\n  \\nThe cortical surface from
      FreeSurfer's main pipeline is further processed to create an outer surface that
      encapsulates the gyral and sulcal curvature for each hemisphere, which serves
      as a basis for calculating a local gyrification index ( ). LGI is measured as
      the amount of cortex within the sulcal folds beneath the outer surface compared
      to the amount of visible cortex that touches the outer surface. Cortical maps
      are generated from repeated iterations of delineating a 25\_mm radius sphere
      on the outer surface and its corresponding point on the cortical surface using
      a matching algorithm. \\n\\n\\n\\n### Background and premorbid characteristics
      \\n  \\n#### Sample characteristics \\n  \\nAge, gender, education level, ethnicity,
      along with other background information, was obtained using a standard demographics
      questionnaire. The two-subtest administration of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale
      of Intelligence (Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning) provided estimates of intellect
      ( ). \\n\\n\\n#### Substance use \\n  \\nThe Substance Use Disorder modules
      of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) ( ) were administered
      by a trained research assistant to assess for lifetime and current symptoms
      of abuse and dependence for alcohol, nicotine, MJ and other substances. The
      SCID interview also provided the onset of use information. A Time Line Follow-Back
      (TLFB) approach was used to quantify alcohol, nicotine, and MJ use patterns
      for 90 days prior to study participation ( ). Marijuana use in grams was obtained
      via self-report in response to probes aimed at quantifying their regular use.
      \\n\\n\\n\\n### Statistical analyses \\n  \\nStatistical analyses were conducted
      in SPSS 18.0 for behavioral and psychosocial measures whereas general linear
      model group comparisons on surfaced-based morphology measures were carried out
      FreeSurfer's built-in application QDEC (v1.5). Independent samples   t  -tests,
      Mann\u2013Whitney   U  -tests or chi-square tests, compared groups on background
      and demographic variables (see  ). Before statistical analysis was conducted,
      the dependent measures of cortical thickness, GWR and LGI were smoothed using
      a FWHM Gaussian filter with a width of either 10 or 15\_mm. Separate univariate
      general linear model (GLM) was then used to model cortical thickness, GWR and
      LGI with onset status of MJ use as a between groups factor. The dependent variables
      were thickness, gray\u2013white ratio or local gyrification index and the independent
      variables were either recent monthly MJ use in grams (MJ grams) or duration
      of MJ use (MJ years). Age and total drinks in the past 2 months were treated
      as nuisance covariates in the model. Using MJ years of use and MJ grams as independent
      predictors of interest allowed us to characterize and differentiate the latent
      developmental effects from cumulative and current effects of MJ use. The variable
      \u201Cmarijuana years of use\u201D was based on the participants\u2019 response
      to the question \u201CFor how many years have you been using marijuana regularly?\u201D
      Of note, an outlier in the early onset group was removed before the statistical
      comparisons were performed. \\n\\n\\n\\n## Results \\n  \\n### Cortical thickness
      \\n  \\nThere were no regions of group differences in cortical thickness by
      early onset status alone, controlled for age and alcohol use. However, MJ use
      characteristics were correlated with anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      thickness based on onset status. Early onset users showed increased thickness
      with increased MJ grams while late onset users showed thinner cortex with increased
      MJ grams (  p  \_<\_0.05 uncorrected) ( ). The same pattern emerged with more
      years of MJ use being associated with thicker region of the right medial temporal
      lobe in the early onset users and the reverse for the late onset users (  p
      \ \_<\_0.05 uncorrected) ( ).   \\nClusters of significant age of onset\_\xD7\_marijuana

      \\n  \\nThere were no regions of group differences in gray\u2013white matter
      contrast by early onset status alone, controlled for age and alcohol use. However,
      current MJ consumption (grams) and onset status were differentially correlated
      with gray\u2013white matter contrast in a left anterior dorsal frontal region
      (  p  \_<\_0.05, FWE corrected). Increased gray\u2013white contrast with heavier
      MJ use was seen in the early onset users and the opposite was seen in later
      onset users (heavier current use linked to decreasing GWR). The same pattern
      was seen between duration of MJ use in two prefrontal cortex clusters of the
      right dorsal frontal and medial orbitofrontal area   p  \_<\_0.05, FWE corrected
      \u2013 more years of MJ use were linked to greater GWR among early users ( ).
      \\n\\n\\n### Gyrification \\n  \\nMJ use onset status alone showed no significant
      main effects above age and alcohol covariates. However, onset status was correlated
      with divergent patterns between local gyrification and MJ use, whereby early
      onset users showed decreasing LGI with increasing MJ consumption and longer
      duration of use in prefrontal cortex regions   p  \_<\_0.05, FWE corrected.
      The left hemisphere clusters encompassed the majority of the length of the middle
      lateral surface of the left cortex, including motor cortices, parietal lobe
      and multimodal integration areas ( ). \\n\\n\\n\\n## Discussion \\n  \\nThe
      present study was designed to characterize the cortical architecture in adolescent
      onset MJ users by comparing early adolescent onset users to late adolescent
      onset in MJ use on measures of cortical thickness, gray/white matter contrast
      and gyrification. The primary finding was that early versus late onset MJ users
      showed a divergent pattern in cortical thickness, definition of the cortical
      ribbon and local gyrification with continued use through and beyond adolescent
      years. Specifically, early onset users showed cortical thickening, enhanced
      gray/white matter contrast, and decreased gyrification in association with more
      years of MJ use and current consumption of MJ in grams in frontal and temporal
      regions \u2013 areas that underlie higher order cognition including executive
      functioning, learning and memory. Findings were above and beyond effects of
      alcohol and current age, therefore, results are less likely to reflect morphological
      trends due to aging. \\n\\nOur findings did not find the expected age of onset
      differences previously reported in marijuana users ( ,  ). This inconsistency
      suggests that the age of onset effects may be more robust in brain white matter
      connectivity ( ) and function ( ) than brain surface morphometry. To date, the
      few studies that have described altered cortical morphology in MJ users have
      led to mixed findings.   identified brain regions with decreased sulcal depth
      suggestive of lower gyrification in a study of adult MJ users.   recently reported
      increased cortical thickness in the entorhinal cortex among 24 adolescent MJ
      users (mean age\_=\_17.7, mean MJ onset age\_=\_15.4) relative to peer controls.
      However, the authors also reported a negative relationship between cortical
      thickness and total MJ use in the right paracentral gyrus, and they observed
      consistent positive relationships in various brain regions between age of MJ
      onset and thickness. In the only other known adolescent study of cortical thickness
      and MJ, Lopez-Larson and colleagues studied 18 adolescent heavy MJ users (similar
      in age and MJ onset as  ) and reported mixed findings of increased thickness
      in prefrontal/insula regions and decreased thickness in posterior/temporal lobe
      areas in the MJ users compared to controls. In contrast to  ,   found areas
      of the frontal lobe and insula that were thinner with increased urine THC metabolites
      and thicker with earlier age of onset. Select findings from the current study
      align with aspects of both of these studies, with a consensus supporting findings
      of a negative dose-dependent relationship between MJ use and cortical thickness.
      Given the low availability of studies to compare, this consensus is very limited.
      Although Jacobus et al. and Lopez-Larson et al. found the opposite effect of
      age of onset on thickness, the pattern of divergence among early vs. late onset
      users in the current study is more consistent with the latter study, whereby
      we saw early onset users exhibit thicker cortex with continued MJ use. Taken
      together, findings of increased thickness related to early MJ onset accompanied
      by negative dose-dependent relationships with MJ exposure may reflect two distinct
      processes. One process may be specific to the interactions with cortical development
      during early adolescence, likely leading to a disruption in pruning, and, the
      other, specific to the pharmacological effect with heavy chronic MJ use. \\n\\nIn
      the only known study to examine the curvature-morphology of the cortex in adult
      MJ users,   identified decreased sulcal concavity and thinner sulci in 23\_MJ
      users compared to controls (  n  \_=\_44), also in prefrontal areas. However,
      they did not observe significant relationships with age, MJ onset age, or cumulative
      MJ use. It is interesting that the authors detected group level differences
      (MJ vs. controls) but no correlations with MJ use characteristics such as dose
      or age of onset, whereas our primary findings are the consistent effects of
      continued MJ use differing after early or late adolescent onset. There are substantial
      methodological explanations for this disparity. For example, the current study
      did not compare morphology in MJ users to a normative control sample, therefore,
      it is feasible that group-level differences may emerge with such a comparison.
      Likewise, we deliberately covaried for current age in order to control for brain
      changes with aging and thus optimize our interrogation of developmental effects
      of early onset age and of aspects of continued use. \\n\\nThe heterogeneity
      of MJ effects clearly suggests a multifactorial system of neurobiological processes
      involved. The primary results uphold that age of onset is a robust variable
      that differentiates heavy MJ users based on early versus late MJ onset. However,
      this group distinction relied on current use characteristics. Therefore, in
      the absence of group-level differences, the interactions between onset age and
      current use indicates that continued cannabis exposure and early adolescent
      developmental factors both contribute to a dynamic and sustained departure from
      what is expected based on developmental studies. \\n\\nTypical synaptic refinement
      processes during early adolescence are in the context of long-term depression
      and potentiation of cortical neurons in order to facilitate neuronal remodeling.
      Thus, the normal course of early adolescent development is uniquely vulnerable
      to disruption by MJ due to the electrochemical conditions and maturity of brain
      processes that would not present together again. Cass and colleagues tested
      the sensitivity of early adolescence cannabinoid exposure in an animal model
      ( ). They found that acute administration of cannabinoid agonists in early,
      middle and late adolescent rats led to a state of frequency-dependent disinhibition
      of neurons in the frontal cortex in the early-to-middle adolescent rats, but
      not in the late adolescent rats. Moreover, the authors also noted that adult
      rats previously exposed to cannabinoid agonists in adolescence displayed comparable
      neuronal disinhibition. Thus, by changing the inhibitory/excitatory landscape
      during adolescence, MJ can influence lasting changes to typical cortical remodeling
      during sensitive early adolescent years. \\n\\nThe sequence of pruning and myelination
      likely plays a formative role in lasting changes from early adolescent onset
      MJ use. With decreased synaptic elimination, our findings of greater GW border
      contrast may reflect greater proliferation of myelin at the boundary of the
      cortical ribbon where non-pruned synapses remained with linked axons. Findings
      of altered white matter tissue qualities are mixed in adolescent and adult MJ
      user samples. Some report both increases and decreases in fractional anisotropy
      (FA) and average water diffusion ( ) whereas others report consistent decreases
      in FA among adolescent MJ users ( ,  ) or null findings ( ). Two studies of
      diffusion tensor imaging in adult MJ users reported reduced FA in users compared
      to controls ( ,  ). In addition to equivocal findings, research is needed to
      address the microstructural changes that could result in altered definition
      of the cortical ribbon. For example, rather than whole brain techniques that
      assess diffusion measures along major white matter tracts, indices assessing
      axonal organization along radial and interneuron association fibers along the
      cortical ribbon are needed. This scenario played out could result in increased
      gray matter (thicker cortex from disrupted pruning) and the myelination of connections
      to these spared terminals would result in increased density of white matter
      at the cortical boundary. Without any known studies of adolescent development
      of the gray/white tissue contrast at the cortical border to serve as a point
      of comparison, we speculate that early adolescent disruption of pruning and
      subsequent myelination of connections at the cortical boundary would be reflected
      by increased GWR as we saw in the current study. \\n\\n\\n## Limitations and
      conclusions \\n  \\nThe cross-sectional nature of this study limits causal attributions
      in terms of what we can infer to be directly related to the effects of MJ. Although
      a longitudinal design is optimal for addressing brain changes directly due to
      MJ, cross-sectional studies facilitate data-driven hypotheses that can be assessed
      directly in prospective studies. \\n\\nIt is important to keep in mind that
      the participants were not explicitly asked for possible years of abstinence
      during their period of regular use, which may have created possible inflation
      in reported duration of regular use. However, because the participants provided
      number of years of \u201Cregular\u201D marijuana use, this inherently suggests
      continued, uninterrupted years of use. Concurrent nicotine use could have also
      influenced our reported results. But in the absence of a larger sample size
      and the presence of huge variance in nicotine use in the current sample, we
      were unable to verify the effect of nicotine use in the reported results. \\n\\nInterpretation
      of these findings is also limited by the lack of behavioral anchors for the
      observed morphological effects and lack of information on other aspects of developmental
      history that could further characterize the effects of marijuana during neurodevelopment.
      This is further limited by the absence of \u201Cexpected\u201D patterns based
      on normative data. Given the varied directions of effects and the small sample
      size, these findings should be replicated and be viewed as preliminary. \\n\\nTo
      conclude, early MJ use was linked to altered neurodevelopmental patterns in
      brain regions sub-serving higher-order cognitive process. Clinical implications
      include need for early, targeted intervention. Given that the most robust results
      were related to interactions between onset age and continued use through emerging
      adulthood, harm reduction approaches may be effective in moderating adolescent
      MJ use to levels that are less likely to cause long-term developmental changes.

      the meaning of abstract mathematical symbols is a cornerstone of arithmetic
      learning in children. Studies have long focused on the role of spatial intuitions
      in the processing of numerals. However, it has been argued that such intuitions
      may also underlie symbols that convey fundamental arithmetic concepts, such
      as arithmetic operators. In the present cross-sectional study, we used fMRI
      to investigate how and when associations between arithmetic operators and brain
      regions processing spatial information emerge in children from 3rd to 10th grade.
      We found that the mere perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign elicited grade-related
      increases of spatial activity in the right hippocampus. That is, merely perceiving
      \u2018+\u2019 signs \u2013 without any operands \u2013 elicited enhanced hippocampal
      activity after around 7th grade (12\u201313 years old). In these children, hippocampal
      activity in response to a \u2018+\u2019 sign was further correlated with the
      degree to which calculation performance was facilitated by the preview of that
      sign before an addition problem, an effect termed operator-priming. Grade-related
      increases of hippocampal spatial activity were operation-specific because they
      were not observed with \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs, which might evoke rote retrieval
      rather than numerical manipulation. Our study raises the possibility that hippocampal
      spatial mechanisms help build associations between some arithmetic operators
      and space throughout age and/or education.Keywords: Arithmetic, Development,
      Attention, Space, fMRI, Hippocampus1.\u2003IntroductionHumans are unique in
      their ability to represent abstract mathematical concepts by culturally invented
      symbols, such as Arabic numerals and arithmetic signs. Because these symbols
      are arbitrary, learning the relationship between their identity and the concept
      they represent is a challenge during early math education in children. Most
      prior studies have focused on the mechanisms supporting the acquisition of symbols
      representing numerical quantities (Piazza et al., 2007, Ansari, 2008, Holloway
      and Ansari, 2009, Lyons and Ansari, 2009, Mundy and Gilmore, 2009). However,
      efficient processing of symbols that convey fundamental arithmetic concepts
      (i.e., operators) may be an important and largely neglected aspect of arithmetic
      skills. This is suggested by the operator-priming effect (Roussel et al., 2002,
      Fayol and Thevenot, 2012, Mathieu et al., 2017), whereby the anticipated presentation
      of a \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019 sign 150\_ms before a single-digit addition
      or subtraction problem facilitates problem-solving in adults.What aspect of
      the processing of an operator may cause the operator-priming effect in adults?
      A first possibility is that an arithmetic sign may automatically evoke a network
      of facts. For example, the perception of a \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019 sign
      might pre-activate a network of additive or subtractive facts that would have
      been built in declarative memory after years of practice (Campbell and Xue,
      2001, Ashcraft, 1992). Pre-activating such a network would facilitate the retrieval
      of the answer from memory when operands are presented. A second possibility
      is that an arithmetic sign may prime a specific procedure that would have been
      \u201Cautomatized\u201D after its repeated practice during arithmetic learning.
      For instance, Fayol and Thevenot argued that perceiving a \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019
      sign might trigger an automatized procedure that could be \u201Clinked to the
      convocation of the mental number line and could correspond to a preparation
      for a quick left-to-right or right-to-left browsing of this mental line\u201D
      (Fayol and Thevenot, 2012). This proposal echoes the idea that adding or subtracting
      numbers involves rightward and leftward shifts of attention from a source to
      a target number along a mental map of numbers oriented from left to right, i.e.,
      the mental number line (MNL) (Hubbard et al., 2005, Masson and Pesenti, 2014,
      Mathieu et al., 2016, Pinheiro-Chagas et al., 2017). Pre-activating such a procedure
      would result in a facilitation of subsequent calculation when operands are presented,
      thereby explaining the operator-priming effect.Interestingly, two lines of evidence
      favor the procedural over the declarative interpretation of the operator-priming
      effect. First, the effect is not observed with the \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign and
      multiplication problems (Roussel et al., 2002, Mathieu et al., 2017). Multiplication
      problems, however, are explicitly learned by rote in school and multiplication
      is unanimously viewed as the operation having the strongest association with
      a network of facts in memory (Campbell and Xue, 2001, Galfano et al., 2003,
      Thibodeau et al., 1996). Therefore, the lack of operator-priming effect for
      multiplication problems is difficult to reconcile with the idea that the effect
      is due to associations between operators and networks of stored facts. Second,
      in line with Fayol and Thevenot\u2019s proposal that \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\u2212\u2019
      signs may prime a spatial scanning of the MNL, a recent study suggests that
      \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\u2212\u2019 signs do evoke spatial intuitions. Specifically,
      Pinhas et al. (2014) found that, when instructed to categorize \u2018+\u2019
      and \u2018\u2212\u2019 signs with left-hand or right-hand responses, adults
      tend to respond faster to \u2018+\u2019 signs with the right hand than with
      the left hand, whereas they tend to respond faster to \u2018-\u2019 signs with
      the left hand than with the right hand (Pinhas et al., 2014). Thus, \u2018+\u2019
      and \u2018\u2212\u2019 signs appear to have some automatic associations with
      the right and left sides of space, respectively.Using fMRI, we recently found
      that such spatial associations may stem from the fact that some arithmetic operators
      are automatically processed in brain regions involved in spatial attention in
      adults. We showed that the mere perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign elicits greater
      activity than the mere perception of a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign in brain regions
      underlying overt spatial attention. These included the frontal eye fields (FEF)
      and the posterior superior parietal lobule (PSPL) (Mathieu et al., 2017). Thus,
      perceiving a \u2018+\u2019 sign (but not a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign) may be associated
      with a deployment of spatial attention in educated adults. Therefore, the rightward
      shifts of attention that have been posited to underlie addition problem-solving
      (Hubbard et al., 2005, Masson and Pesenti, 2014, Mathieu et al., 2016) might
      be primed by the mere preview of the addition sign (but not by the preview of
      a multiplication sign because multiplication is typically learned by rote and
      unlikely to be associated with movements along the MNL). Overall, there is mounting
      evidence that at least some arithmetic operators (e.g., \u2018+\u2019 but not
      \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs) evoke spatial intuitions in adults, and that these intuitions
      may relate to the operator-priming effect.However, associations between operators
      and space are arguably not innate. Therefore, a fundamental outstanding question
      is how and when such associations emerge in the developing brain. To answer
      that question, we studied 34 children from 3rd to 10th grade while they performed
      3 tasks. First, fMRI activity was measured while children were instructed to
      make eye saccades towards visually presented targets. This allowed us to precisely
      localize several regions of interest (ROIs) involved in spatial attention across
      children. Second, fMRI activity was measured in these spatial attention ROIs
      while children were presented with trials in which a \u2018+\u2019 sign was
      displayed without any operands (hereafter addition sign-only trials). As in
      our previous study in adults (Mathieu et al., accepted), activity during the
      perception of addition sign-only trials was compared to activity associated
      with trials in which a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign was displayed without any operands
      (hereafter multiplication sign-only trials) because these do not appear to evoke
      any specific intuitions in adults (Fayol and Thevenot 2012). This allowed us
      to identify the spatial attention ROIs in which activity in response to a \u2018+\u2019
      sign (as compared to a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign) increases with age and/or education,
      as well as the developmental time course of these effects.1 Third, outside of
      the scanner, we asked subjects to perform an operator-priming task and measured
      the correlation between inter-individual differences in the size of the operator-priming
      effect and inter-individual differences in sign-related activity in spatial
      attention ROIs as a function of grade. This allowed us to evaluate when sign-related
      activity in spatial attention ROIs leads to an operator-priming effect in children.2.\u2003Material
      and methods2.1. ParticipantsForty-two right-handed children from 3rd to 10th
      grade participated in the study. All were native French speakers. Participants
      did not have prior history of neurological disease, psychiatric disorders, learning
      disabilities or attention deficits. All children and parents provided written
      informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the local
      ethics committee (CPP Sud-Est-II). Families received 80\u20AC for their participation.
      Data from 8 subjects were excluded because of excessive head-movement in the
      scanner (see criteria in the Section 2.7., n\_=\_3), poor whole-brain coverage
      (i.e. susceptibility artefacts from dental braces, n\_=\_3) and unacceptably
      low performance during the task (i.e., lower than 50% accuracy on the sign-plus-operand
      trials, n\_=\_2). Therefore, the final sample consisted of 34 children (20 males)
      from 3rd to 10th grade (age range: 8\u201315, mean age\_=\_11.37, SD\_=\_1.84).
      For each child, a continuous measure of grade was calculated by taking into
      account the specific date within the grade year when that child was scanned.
      The whole sample (n\_=\_34) was evenly split into three groups as a function
      of grade: 11 children were from the \u2018lower grades\u2019 group (grade 3.2\u20135.4;
      mean\_=\_4.4), 11 children were from the \u2018intermediate grades\u2019 group
      (grade 5.6\u20136.9; mean\_=\_6.2), and 12 children were from the \u2018higher
      grades\u2019 group (grade 7.6\u201310.2; mean\_=\_8.5).2.2. Standardized measuresChildren
      were administered standardized tests of intellectual and arithmetic abilities
      to ensure that there were no age differences with respect to those measures.
      Full-scale IQ was measured using the NEMI-2 (Cognet, 2006). Basic arithmetic
      knowledge was evaluated with the Math-Fluency subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson-III
      Tests of Achievement (WJ-III) (Woodcock et al., 2001). Across all participants,
      standardized (i.e., age-normalized) scores on IQ (mean\_=\_112; SD\_=\_10) and
      Math Fluency (mean\_=\_106; SD\_=\_16) tests were within the normal range. One-way
      ANOVAs with the between-subject factor group (lower, intermediate, higher grades)
      revealed no main effect of group on IQ (F(2,31)\_=\_0.591, p\_=\_0.560, BF10\_=\_0.29),
      indicating that age-normalized intellectual abilities were similar across groups.
      However, there was a main effect of group on Math Fluency (F(2,31)\_=\_5.867,
      p\_=\_0.007, BF10\_=\_7.24): Children from intermediate grades had a higher
      age-normalized score (mean\_=\_118; SD\_=\_18) than children from lower (mean\_=\_100;
      SD\_=\_11) and higher grades (mean\_=\_100; SD\_=\_13). Therefore, we included
      standardized Math-Fluency scores as nuisance covariate in all of our analyses.2.3.
      Behavioral sessionAfter standardized testing, children participated in a behavioral
      session during which they performed an operator-priming task adapted from Fayol
      and Thevenot (2012) and Roussel et al. (2002). Children were asked to evaluate
      56 single-digit addition and 56 multiplication problems composed of operands
      between 2 and 9. Problems were presented in both commutative orders. Tie problems
      were excluded. Problems with a sum smaller than or equal to 11 and a product
      smaller or equal to 24 were considered small. Other problems were considered
      large.In each trial, a problem was presented with an answer (Fig. 1a). The arithmetic
      sign was presented either 150\_ms before (Negative SOA condition) or at the
      same time (Null SOA condition) as the operands (Fig. 1a). All problems were
      presented once in both SOA condition with a valid answer. Twenty-eight addition
      and 28 multiplication problems were also presented in both SOA condition with
      an invalid answer (obtained by adding or subtracting 1 to or from the valid
      answer). Trials were pseudorandomly ordered so that no more than three problems
      of the same type appeared consecutively. Problems with an invalid answer were
      randomly chosen across subjects and the order of blocks was counter-balanced
      between subjects. The experiment started with 8 practice trials.Open in a separate
      windowFig. 1Experimental design. (a) During the behavioral session, children
      (n\_=\_34) were asked to evaluate the result of single-digit addition and multiplication
      problems. For both operations, the arithmetic sign was presented either 150\_ms
      before (negative SOA trials), or at the same time as the operands (null SOA
      trials). (b) In the scanner, children (n\_=\_34) performed an arithmetic task
      during which they were presented with sign-only (left) and sign-plus-operands
      (right) addition, multiplication and baseline trials. In each trial, a sign
      (\u2018+\u2019, \u2018\xD7\u2019 or \u2018\u25CA\u2019) was presented at the
      center of the screen for 150\_ms. In sign-only trials, the trial ended with
      the presentation of the sign and was simply followed by the inter-trial period
      of fixation. In sign-plus-operands trials (filler trials), the \u2018+\u2019
      or \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign was immediately followed by a single-digit addition
      or multiplication problem (respectively) presented along an answer and the \u2018\u25CA\u2019
      sign was followed by 3 letters. In those cases, children had 5000\_ms to evaluate
      whether the answer of the problem was true or false or to indicate whether one
      of the 3 letters was a B.The experiment was controlled by Presentation software
      (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA). Problems were displayed in white Arial
      60-point font on a black background. All trials started with the presentation
      of a white central fixation dot for 1500\_ms, immediately followed by a red
      central fixation dot for 1000\_ms signaling that the problem was about to be
      presented, either in the negative SOA condition or in the null SOA condition
      (Fig. 1a). Subjects had a maximum of 5000\_ms to evaluate whether the response
      was valid or invalid as quickly as possible by pressing one of two keys on the
      computer keyboard.2.4. fMRI sessionDuring fMRI scanning, children performed
      a spatial attention localizer task and an arithmetic task. The spatial attention
      localizer task consisted in alternating blocks of fixation and saccades. During
      saccade blocks (n\_=\_9), participants were asked to make saccades towards several
      successive target dots. Each saccade block contained 16 target dots (0.2\xB0
      visual angle) that appeared at random positions with an eccentricity of 3\xB0,
      3.5\xB0, 4\xB0, 4.5\xB0, 5\xB0 or 5.5\xB0 in the left or right visual field
      for an average of 800\_ms (with a jitter of \xB1200\_ms). During fixation blocks
      (n\_=\_9), participants were asked to maintain fixation on a central dot for
      12,800\_ms. Block order was counterbalanced across children.During the arithmetic
      task, children were presented with sign-only and sign-plus-operands versions
      of addition and multiplication trials (Fig. 1b). Each trial started with the
      presentation of either a \u2018+\u2019 or a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign at the center
      of the screen for 150\_ms. In sign-only trials (n\_=\_30), the trial ended with
      the presentation of the sign and was simply followed by the inter-trial period
      of fixation (see below). These sign-only trials were our trials of interest
      and allowed us to isolate neural activity due to the presentation of a sign
      alone. We also included in the experiment sign-plus-operands trials (n\_=\_50).
      In those filler trials, the \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign was immediately
      followed by a single-digit addition or multiplication problem (respectively)
      presented with an answer. Participants were asked to indicate whether the answer
      was true or false. The goal of these filler trials (for which associated activity
      would be difficult to interpret because any effects could be attributable to
      the anticipatory presentation of the operator, the appearance of the operands,
      or a combination of both of these factors) was only to keep children engaged
      and attentive in the scanner. They also induced an arithmetic context, thereby
      ensuring that the \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs presented in sign-only
      trials were perceived as arithmetic signs. Problems in sign-plus-operand trials
      were constructed following the same criteria as in the behavioral session. Finally,
      the baseline consisted in trials in which the arithmetic sign was replaced by
      an abstract non-arithmetic sign (i.e., \u2018\u25CA\u2019). We included 30 baseline
      sign-only trials (in which the \u2018\u25CA\u2019 sign was presented in isolation)
      and 50 baseline sign-plus-operand trials (in which the \u2018\u25CA\u2019 sign
      was followed by 3 letters and participants had to indicate whether one of these
      letters was a B). All trials were followed by a variable period of visual fixation
      ranging from 3000\_ms to 3800\_ms. That period consisted in a central white
      fixation dot that turned red 1000\_ms before the onset of the next trial. The
      arithmetic task was decomposed in 4 functional runs. All trials were intermixed
      and the timing and order of trial presentation within each run was optimized
      for estimation efficiency using optseq2 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/optseq/).
      Behavioral responses were recorded using an MR-compatible response device.Stimuli
      were generated using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany,
      CA). Prior scanning, children were familiarized with the fMRI environment during
      a practice session that took place after the standardized testing and the behavioral
      session. During this practice session, children learned to minimize head movement
      in a mock fMRI scanner. The actual scanning session took place no more than
      3 weeks after the practice session.2.5. Behavioral analysesRT data associated
      with the operator-priming task were normalized using a logarithmic transformation
      prior all analyses to improve the conformity of the data to the standard assumptions
      of parametric testing. Following Fayol and Thevenot (2012), mean RT was analyzed
      using planned comparisons that followed from a within-subject ANOVA with the
      factors Operation (Addition/Multiplication) and SOA (Negative/Null), conducted
      separately for each group. We report for all effects the corresponding Bayes
      factors (BF10), indicating the strength of evidence for the alternative hypothesis
      (H1) relative to the null hypothesis (H0). Substantial evidence in favor of
      the alternative hypothesis is typically suggested by a BF10 greater than 3 (Jeffreys,
      1961, Dienes, 2011).2.6. fMRI data acquisitionImages were collected with a Siemens
      Prisma 3T MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) at the CERMEP
      Imagerie du vivant in Lyon, France. The BOLD signal was measured with a susceptibility
      weighted single-shot EPI sequence. Imaging parameters were as follows: TR\_=\_2000\_ms,
      TE\_=\_24\_ms, flip angle\_=\_80\xB0, matrix size\_=\_128\_\xD7\_120, field
      of view\_=\_220\_\xD7\_206\_mm, slice thickness\_=\_3\_mm (0.48\_mm gap), number
      of slices\_=\_32. A high-resolution T1-weighted whole-brain anatomical volume
      was also collected for each participant. Parameters were as follows: TR\_=\_3500\_ms,
      TE\_=\_2.24\_ms, flip angle\_=\_8\xB0, matrix size\_=\_256\_\xD7\_256, field
      of view\_=\_224\_\xD7\_224\_mm, slice thickness\_=\_0.9\_mm, number of slices\_=\_192.2.7.
      fMRI preprocessingData analysis was performed using SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).
      Functional images were corrected for slice acquisition delays and spatially
      realigned to the first image of the first run. Images were then spatially smoothed
      with a Gaussian filter equal to twice the voxel size. ArtRepair was used to
      help remove motion from the functional images prior to normalization (Mazaika
      et al., 2009). Volumes with rapid scan-to-scan movements of greater than 1.5\_mm
      were repaired by interpolation of the two nearest non-repaired scans. Each run
      with more than 5% of the total number of volumes replaced was removed from the
      analyses. A subject was excluded from further analysis if more than one run
      was removed. The number of volumes replaced did not differ between grade groups
      (F(2,31)\_=\_2.20; p\_=\_0.13). Finally, functional images were normalized into
      the standard MNI space (normalized voxel size, 2\_\xD7\_2\_\xD7\_3.5\_mm3).2.8.
      fMRI processingEvent-related statistical analysis was performed according to
      the general linear model (GLM). For the localizer task, brain activity associated
      with saccades and fixation blocks was modeled as epochs with onsets and offsets
      time-locked to the beginning and the end of each block. Each epoch was convolved
      with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the time series data
      from each run were high-pass filtered (1/128\_Hz). Finally, serial correlations
      were corrected using an autoregressive AR(1) model. Following our previous study
      using the same task in adults (Mathieu et al., 2017), brain activity associated
      with sign-only trials during the arithmetic task was estimated using a finite
      impulse response (FIR) model. We modeled 8 time points with an interval of 2\_s
      (corresponding to one TR) ranging from the onset of the sign to 16\_s after
      the sign. The magnitude of the fMRI response for each type of sign-only trial
      was calculated by subtracting activity at the onset of the sign (i.e., 1st bin,
      or 0\_s after the onset) from the peak activity (i.e., 4th bin, or \u223C8\_s
      after the onset). The time series data from each run were high-pass filtered
      (1/128\_Hz), and serial correlations were corrected using an autoregressive
      AR(1) model.2.9. Region of interest (ROI) definition and analysesThe present
      study used a Region-of-Interest (ROI) approach to analyze brain activity associated
      with sign-only trials in brain regions involved in the orienting of spatial
      attention in children. All ROIs were independently defined using the contrast
      of saccades versus fixation blocks in the spatial attention localizer task.
      All subject-specific contrasts were entered into a random effect (RFX) one-sample
      t-test across subjects. The RFX contrast map was then thresholded across the
      whole-brain using an uncorrected voxel-level threshold of p\_<\_0.001 and a
      false-discovery-rate (FDR) corrected cluster-level threshold of p\_<\_0.05 (Chumbley
      and Friston 2009). Using the SPM toolbox Marsbar (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/),
      ROIs were defined as 6-mm radius spheres around the peak coordinate of each
      region.Within each ROI and for each participant, we calculated the average response
      (parameter estimates) for \u2018+\u2019 signs using the contrast of addition
      sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials. Similarly, we calculated
      the average response for \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs using the contrast of multiplication
      sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials. Two analyses were performed
      in each ROI. First, we identified the ROI(s) in which a difference in fMRI activity
      between \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs emerged throughout age and/or
      education, using a 3\_\xD7\_2 ANOVA with the between-subject factor group (lower/intermediate/higher
      grades) and the within-subject factor sign (\u2018+\u2019/\u2018\xD7\u2019).
      Second, we tested in these ROIs whether inter-individual differences in the
      fMRI response to an arithmetic sign were correlated with inter-individual differences
      in the size of the operator-priming effect (measured in the behavioral session)
      for each group. In all analyses, we report uncorrected P values as well as P
      values corrected for multiple comparisons across all identified ROIs using the
      Bonferroni procedure. Bayes factor are also reported.3.\u2003Results3.1. The
      spatial localizer task activates a brain network encompassing frontal, parietal,
      occipital and hippocampal regionsContrasting saccades to fixation blocks in
      the spatial attention localizer task, we first identified 10 clusters supporting
      the orienting of spatial attention across subjects: the bilateral Frontal Eye
      Field (FEF), bilateral Posterior Superior Parietal Lobule (PSPL), bilateral
      Middle Temporal Gyri (MTG), bilateral Middle Occipital Gyri (MOG), right dorsal
      Inferior Frontal Gyrus (dIFG), and right Hippocampus (see Table 1 and Fig. 2).
      Therefore, a large brain network was involved in the orienting of spatial attention
      across subjects. Each of these regions served as an ROI in subsequent analyses.Table

      The right hippocampus region identified by the spatial localizer task is increasingly
      activated in response to a \u2018+\u2019 sign but not to a \u2018\xD7\u2019
      sign throughout age and/or educationA 3\_\xD7\_2 ANOVA with the between-subject
      factor group (lower/intermediate/higher grades) and the within-subject factor
      sign (\u2018+\u2019/\u2018\xD7\u2019) was then conducted in each of the 10 ROIs
      identified by the spatial attention localizer. We found an interaction between
      group and sign in the right hippocampus (F(2.30)\_=\_6.75, p\_=\_0.0038, pcorr\_=\_0.038;
      Fig. 3a and b), but not in any other ROIs (all Fs\_<\_3.44, all ps\_>\_0.046,
      all pscorr\_>\_0.46). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for
      this interaction in the right hippocampus (BF10\_=\_11.53), while no or anecdotal
      evidence for such an interaction was found in the other ROIs (BF10\_<\_1.63).
      Follow-up t-tests in the hippocampus ROI revealed that children from higher
      grades (average grade\_=\_8.5) exhibited greater activity for addition than
      multiplication sign-only trials (t11\_=\_3.02, p\_=\_0.012), whereas there was
      no difference between signs in children from intermediate grades (average grade\_=\_6.2)
      (t10\_=\_0.87, p\_=\_0.41) and even a trend for less activity for addition than
      multiplication sign-only trials in children from lower grades (average grade\_=\_4.4)
      (t10\_=\_2.22, p\_=\_0.051). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence
      for a difference of activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials
      in children from higher grades (BF10\_=\_5.21), but evidence for this difference
      was absent in intermediate grades (BF10\_=\_0.41) and anecdotal in lower grades
      (BF10\_=\_1.69). Finally, across all groups, addition sign-only trials were
      associated with greater activity than baseline sign-only trials in children
      from higher grades (t11\_=\_2.63, p\_=\_0.023), but not in any other groups
      (all ts\_<\_1.32, all ps\_>\_0.21). Multiplication sign-only trials were associated
      with greater activity than baseline sign-only trials in none of the groups (all
      ts\_<\_1.38, all ps\_>\_0.20). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence
      for a difference between addition sign-only trials and baseline sign-only trials
      in children from higher grades (BF10\_=\_3.00), but no or anecdotal evidence
      in the other groups (all BF10s\_<\_0.60) and for multiplication sign-only trials
      (all BF10s\_<\_0.63). Overall, then, a difference in fMRI response to a \u2018+\u2019
      and a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign emerged throughout age and/or education in the right
      hippocampus.Open in a separate windowFig. 3Grade-related changes of activity

      over grade in the right Hippocampus. *p\_<\_0.05; r represents the Pearson correlation
      coefficient.The findings above were confirmed by an additional correlation analysis
      in which grade was treated as a continuous predictor across all subjects. The
      difference in activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials
      was positively correlated with grade in the right hippocampus (r\_=\_0.53, p\_=\_0.001,
      pcorr\_=\_0.01; Fig. 3c). No other significant grade-related changes were found
      in any other regions (all rs\_<\_0.38, all ps\_>\_0.03, all pscorr\_>\_0.30).
      Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for this correlation in
      the right hippocampus (BF10\_=\_20.97), but no or anecdotal evidence in any
      other ROIs (all BF10s\_<\_2.03). In the right hippocampus, the correlation between
      grade and the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials, was also near significance (r\_=\_0.33, p\_=\_0.056; BF10\_=\_1.22).2
      The correlation between grade and the contrast of multiplication sign-only trials
      versus baseline sign-only trials, however, was not significant (r\_=\_\u22120.18,
      p\_=\_0.32; BF10\_=\_0.35).3.3. Spatial hippocampal activity in response to
      a \u2018+\u2019 sign relates to an addition-priming effect in children from
      higher gradesWe then tested whether the hippocampal response to a \u2018+\u2019
      sign observed in children from higher grades was related to the operator-priming
      effect. To this aim, each child performed a version of the operator-priming
      task outside of the scanner (see Fig. 1a).First, we tested whether the results
      obtained by Fayol and Thevenot (2012) in adults (i.e., an operator-priming effect
      for addition but not for multiplication across subjects) could be extended to
      our children participants. Because children from lower grades had a performance
      close to chance on large problems (58%), we exclusively focused our analyses
      on small problems for which accuracy was significantly above chance in all groups
      (lower grades: 80%, intermediate grades: 92%, higher grades: 96%). Planned comparisons
      revealed an operator-priming effect for addition in children from higher grades
      (1491\_ms versus 1577\_ms; F(1,11)\_=\_8.11, p\_=\_0.016), but not in children
      from lower grades (2289\_ms versus 2417\_ms; F(1,10)\_=\_2.66, p\_=\_0.134)
      and intermediate grades (1530 versus 1509\_ms; F(1,10)\_=\_0.01, p\_=\_0.941).
      No operator-priming effect for multiplication was observed in any groups (lower
      grades: F(1,10)\_=\_3.50, p\_=\_0.091; intermediate grades: F(1,10)\_=\_1.52,
      p\_=\_0.246; higher grades: F(1,11)\_=\_0.14, p\_=\_0.715). Bayes Factor analysis
      indicated substantial evidence for an operator-priming effect with addition
      problems in children from higher grades (BF10\_=\_4.08), but no evidence in
      children from intermediate (BF10\_=\_0.30) and lower (BF10\_=\_0.83) grades.
      There was also no or anecdotal evidence for an operator-priming effect with
      multiplication problems in any group (higher grades: BF10\_=\_0.31; intermediate
      grades: BF10\_=\_0.55; lower grades: BF10\_=\_1.09).Second, we tested whether
      the size of the operator-priming effect in children (measured on small problems)
      was correlated to the magnitude of the response for addition sign-only trials
      versus baseline sign-only trials in the right hippocampus. Such a correlation
      was found to be highly significant in children from higher grades (r\_=\_0.82,
      p\_=\_0.0012, Fig. 4), surviving Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
      between the two conditions and across the three groups (pcorr\_=\_0.007). That
      is, children from higher grades who show greater responses to \u2018+\u2019
      signs in the right hippocampus are those who show larger operator-priming effect
      with addition problems. No significant correlation was found in children from
      lower (r\_=\_0.15, p\_=\_0.66 Fig. 4) and intermediate (r\_=\_0.24, p\_=\_0.48,
      Fig. 4) grades. Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for the
      correlation in children from higher grades (BF10\_=\_38.15), but no evidence
      in children from lower (BF10\_=\_0.40) and intermediate (BF10\_=\_0.46) grades.
      There was also no significant (and anecdotal evidence for a) correlation between
      the operator-priming effect for addition problems and the fMRI response to multiplication
      sign-only trials (compared to baseline sign-only trials) in the right hippocampus,
      in any of the groups (lower grades: r\_=\_0.06, p\_=\_0.87, BF10\_=\_0.37; intermediate
      grades: r\_=\_0.32, p\_=\_0.34, BF10\_=\_0.56; higher grades: r\_=\_0.51, p\_=\_0.09,
      BF10\_=\_1.28). Therefore, not only did we observe an operator-priming effect
      for addition in the only group in which we also observed a greater hippocampal
      response to \u2018+\u2019 than \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs (i.e., children from higher
      grades), but inter-individual differences in the size of the operator-priming
      effect in that group was also related to hippocampal activity.Open in a separate
      windowFig. 4Hippocampus brain-behavior correlation over grade.Activity in the
      right hippocampus in response to addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials as a function of the operator-priming effect calculated in the behavioral
      session for addition problems in children from lower (n\_=\_11; grade 3.2\u20135.4;
      mean grade\_=\_4.4; mean age\_=\_9.4), intermediate (n\_=\_11; grade 5.6\u20136.9;
      mean grade\_=\_6.2; mean age\_=\_11.1) and higher grades (n\_=\_12; grade 7.6\u201310.2;
      mean grade\_=\_8.5; mean age\_=\_13.4). r represents the Pearson correlation
      coefficient.Third, we tested whether the correlation between the operator-priming
      effect and the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials increased over grade. This was done by transforming the correlation coefficient
      in each group to a Fischer\u2019s z score before comparing the groups using
      the cocor package (Diedenhofen and Musch, 2015). Although the correlation was
      not greater in children from intermediate than lower grades (z\_=\_0.19, p\_=\_0.43,
      one-tailed), it was significantly greater in children from higher than lower
      grades (z\_=\_2.07, p\_=\_0.019, one-tailed) and in children from higher than
      intermediate grades (z\_=\_1.88, p\_=\_0.030, one-tailed). Therefore, this brain-behavior
      correlation increased over grade.4.\u2003DiscussionIn the present study, we
      used fMRI and a cross-sectional design to investigate (i) how and when spatial
      processing related to the perception of an addition sign emerges in the developing
      brain, and (ii) to what extent it contributes to the emergence of an operator-priming
      effect.4.1. The mere perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign is associated with increased
      hippocampal spatial activity throughout age and/or educationIt has been shown
      that the processing of a \u2018+\u2019 sign is associated with the right side
      of space (Pinhas et al., 2014) and activates brain regions involved in overt
      spatial attention in adults (Mathieu et al., 2017). Therefore, we expected arithmetic
      learning to be associated with increased recruitment of brain regions involved
      in spatial attention in response to the perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign throughout
      age and/or education in children. This was the case in a region of the right
      hippocampus that we identified in our spatial attention localizer task. Therefore,
      it is possible that hippocampal spatial mechanisms may scaffold the progressive
      association between an arithmetic operator (i.e., a \u2018+\u2019 sign) and
      spatial intuitions throughout age and/or education. There is increasing evidence
      that the hippocampal formation, and particularly the right hippocampus, may
      house a \u2018sense of space\u2019 (Buffalo, 2015). Specifically, the right
      hippocampus has been extensively reported to support spatial representation
      and navigation in humans (Maguire et al., 1998, Burgess et al., 2002) as well
      as in non-human primates and rodents (O'keefe and Nadel, 1978, Bird and Burgess,
      2008). For example, the hippocampus is typically activated when human participants
      learn to navigate through a mental representation of space (i.e., mental scanning)
      (Mellet et al., 2002, Spiers and Maguire, 2006). Interestingly, a recent study
      in monkeys demonstrated that neurons in the hippocampal formation may encode
      the direction of overt (Killian et al., 2015) as well as covert (Wilming et
      al., 2015) shifts of attention. Therefore, the hippocampal formation is likely
      a critical region for both representing a mental map of space and navigating
      along that map (Killian et al., 2012, Meister and Buffalo, 2016).Why would such
      a hippocampal spatial navigation mechanism be increasingly recruited by the
      mere perception of a\u2019+\u2019 sign throughout age and/or education? One
      possibility is that this mechanism might enable children to construct a detailed
      representation of numbers in mental space, as well as to navigate along that
      mental representation. Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence that numbers of
      increasing size are organized along a left-to-right mental map (i.e., the MNL)
      in adults (Fischer and Shaki 2014). This spatial representation may enable individuals
      to add or subtract numbers by navigating from a source to a target number to
      the left or right of that MNL. This is supported by behavioral studies showing
      that addition and subtraction problem-solving is associated with rightward and
      leftward shifts of attention (Masson and Pesenti, 2014, Mathieu et al., 2016),
      as well as by a neuroimaging study indicating an overlap between the brain regions
      involved in overt shifts of attention and those involved in arithmetic calculation
      in adults (Knops et al., 2009). Such strategies may be acquired early by children,
      sometimes even explicitly in the classroom where addition and subtraction is
      often demonstrated on visual number lines. Yet, it is only with practice that
      they might become progressively attached to and evoked by an arithmetic operator
      such as a \u2018+\u2019, which might explain the grade-related increases of
      activity in this region in response to the \u2018+\u2019 sign (and the fact
      that it is only by 7th grade that children exhibit significant activity in response
      to that sign).4.2. Hippocampal spatial activity in response to a \u2018+\u2019
      sign relates to the operator-priming effect in children from higher gradesA
      critical question is to what extent this automatic processing of a \u2018+\u2019
      sign in hippocampal spatial mechanisms is associated with children\u2019s behavior.
      To answer this question, we asked all children to perform a version of the operator-priming
      task developed by Fayol and Thevenot (2012) and Roussel et al. (2002). First,
      we replicated the operator-priming effect observed in adults with addition problems
      (i.e., a facilitation of problem-solving when the operator is presented 150\_ms
      before the operands), but only in children from higher grades (after around
      7th grade). Like in adults, this effect was specific to addition problems and
      not observed with multiplication problems. Thus, the perception of a \u2018+\u2019
      sign (but not that of a \u2018\xD7\u2019 sign) appears to pre-activate a process
      that is likely used to solve the subsequent problem in children from higher
      grades. More central to our current interest, we found that the size of the
      operator-priming effect in these children was highly correlated with the degree
      of activation of hippocampal spatial mechanisms in response to a \u2018+\u2019
      sign. This indicates that hippocampal spatial activity may be at the source
      of the operator priming-effect in older children, perhaps because these children
      might prepare for an attentional movement along the MNL as soon as a \u2018+\u2019
      sign is presented. Because no brain-behavior correlation was observed in younger
      children, extensive practice might be needed before such mechanisms are triggered
      by the mere perception of the sign.4.3. Hippocampal spatial activity in response
      to a \u2018+\u2019 sign is transient in developmentStrikingly, the spatial brain
      mechanisms that respond to the mere perception of a \u2018+\u2019 sign appear
      to be different in children and adults. That is, albeit we found increased hippocampal
      spatial activity throughout age and/or education in the present study, we did
      not identify these mechanisms in our previous study in adult participants using
      the exact same task (Mathieu et al., 2017). Rather, we found increased activity
      in response to a \u2018+\u2019 sign in neocortical regions of the FEF and PSPL
      in adults. Therefore, the contribution of the hippocampus to the automatic processing
      of a \u2018+\u2019 sign is likely transient. Such a transient involvement of
      the hippocampus is consistent with a wealth of studies that have demonstrated
      that the spatial representations initially supported by the hippocampus during
      learning become independent from this brain structure over experience and transferred
      to neocortical regions (Rosenbaum et al., 2004, Hirshhorn et al., 2012b). For
      example, longitudinal studies demonstrate that right hippocampal activity associated
      with learning to mentally navigate through a new environment disappears and
      is replaced by neocortical activity when individuals become familiar with that
      environment (Spiers and Maguire, 2007, Hirshhorn et al., 2012a). It is possible
      that the same phenomenon is at play here: The hippocampus may be involved in
      the early representation of (and navigation along) the MNL before that representation
      is transferred to neocortical regions of the fronto-parietal cortex. Future
      investigations with a wider age sample than in the present study are needed
      to test this hypothesis.4.4. Can right hippocampal involvement in the present
      study reflect mnemonic operations involved in learning arithmetic?Although there
      is no doubt that the hippocampus supports spatial processing (Burgess et al.,
      2002, Spiers and Maguire, 2007), this brain structure is also well known to
      support the encoding and consolidation of verbal declarative knowledge into
      long-term memory (Eichenbaum, 2004). In fact, previous developmental studies
      have largely explained the involvement of the hippocampus during arithmetic
      learning by referring to its role in declarative memory rather than spatial
      processing (Rivera et al., 2005, De Smedt et al., 2011, Cho et al., 2011, Cho
      et al., 2012, Qin et al., 2014). This interpretation relies on the claim that
      results of well-practiced arithmetic facts (e.g., 2\_+\_3 or 4\_\xD7\_2) might
      become progressively retrieved from memory (rather than calculated) over the
      course of learning and development (Campbell and Xue, 2001). The hippocampus
      might thus support the encoding and consolidation of networks of arithmetic
      facts in children.Can the role of the hippocampus in declarative memory explain
      the operator-specific activity over grade (and correlation with the operator-priming
      effect) observed in the region of the right hippocampus identified by our spatial
      localizer task? We acknowledge that we did not have a task identifying processes
      involved in declarative memory. Thus, even if the right hippocampus is usually
      more associated with spatial than mnemonic processes (Burgess et al., 2002),
      it is possible that the hippocampal cluster that we identified as being involved
      in spatial processing may also be involved in some aspects of declarative memory.
      One might thus argue that grade-related increases of activity in relation to
      \u2018+\u2019 signs reflect the progressive association between a \u2018+\u2019
      and a network of additive facts. This explanation, however, can be ruled out
      by an examination of activity related to \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs. Because single-digit
      multiplication problems are almost exclusively learned by rote in school, multiplication
      is the operation that is perhaps the most associated with a network of stored
      facts in the literature (Campbell and Xue, 2001). Thus, if increased hippocampal
      activity in relation to \u2018+\u2019 signs were due to the progressive building
      of a network of additive facts, increased activity in that same region should
      have been observed during the perception of \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs (perhaps
      even more so for the perception of \u2018+\u2019 signs). Yet, this is not the
      case. Not only did we not find any grade-related increase of activity for \u2018\xD7\u2019
      signs in the hippocampal cluster identified by our spatial localizer task, but
      activity was significantly greater for \u2018+\u2019 than \u2018\xD7\u2019 signs
      in higher graders (who are as proficient in single-digit multiplication as addition).
      Similarly, no operator-priming effect was observed for multiplication problems
      in higher graders, indicating that the operator-priming effect observed for
      addition is likely to have little to do with the pre-activation of a network
      of stored facts (because this should be also observed for multiplication). Therefore,
      the specificity of our results to \u2018+\u2019 signs (as compared to \u2018\xD7\u2019
      signs) in the right hippocampus ROI makes it very unlikely that our results
      are related to mnemonic operations. In our view, emerging associations between
      \u2018+\u2019 signs and spatial intuitions related to the MNL are the best explanation
      of the effects reported here.Of course, the fact that the role of the hippocampus
      in declarative memory is unlikely to explain our operator-specific findings
      in the right hippocampus ROI does not mean that hippocampal mechanisms supporting
      mnemonic operations do not contribute to arithmetic learning. Instead, they
      indicate that the hippocampus might contribute to arithmetic learning through
      its role in both declarative memory and spatial processing. Interestingly, the
      operator-specific activity observed in our (spatially localized) right hippocampal
      cluster is not observed in a mirror (left lateralized) cluster that is not activated
      in the localizer contrast (see Supplementary information). In that mirror region,
      no difference was observed between activity related to \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\xD7\u2019
      signs in any group of children (and left hippocampal activity was not related
      to the operator-priming effect). Thus, the developmental effect reported here
      appears to be restricted to the right hippocampus. This specificity suggests
      that the observed developmental changes in the right hippocampus may not simply
      reflect general brain maturation but rather mechanisms that are specific to
      arithmetic learning.4.5. LimitationsIt is worth acknowledging here 2 potential
      limitations of the present work. First, as is the case for any cross-sectional
      fMRI studies, our study is correlational in nature. Thus, although our findings
      are consistent with the idea that the right hippocampus might scaffold the progressive
      association between (at least some) arithmetic operators and space throughout
      age and/or education, future studies might specifically investigate the causal
      role of these hippocampal mechanisms. Second, our finding of a correlation between
      grade and the processing of an addition sign in the right hippocampus (see Fig.
      3C) relies on a relatively large sample size of 34 children. However, other
      findings involve subgroups of participants and therefore rely on smaller sample
      sizes. In particular, null findings in relation to these subgroups might be
      difficult to interpret because of potential lack of power. For example, whereas
      we found an operator-priming effect in children from higher grades and no effect
      in children from intermediate grades, there was no significant difference between
      these groups in terms of response times in negative SOA trials (1491\_ms versus
      1530\_ms; t21\_=\_0.21; p\_=\_0.84; BF10\_=\_0.39). Behavioral studies focusing
      on the operator-priming effect in children might test whether this difference
      emerges with larger sample sizes. More generally, future studies are needed
      to improve our understanding of the present results.5.\u2003ConclusionIn sum,
      our findings suggest that the right hippocampus might contribute to the progressive
      association between (at least some) arithmetic operators and space throughout
      age and/or education. Therefore, our study raises the possibility that increased
      hippocampal activity during arithmetic learning in children may be explained
      by the role of this structure in spatial representations as well as in declarative
      memory.Conflict of interestThe authors declare no competing financial interests.AcknowledgmentsThis

      that to induce an arithmetic context and disguise the goal of the experiment,
      we also included trials in which a \u2018\_+\_\u2019 or a \u2018\_\xD7\_\u2019
      sign was followed 150\_ms later by operands and participants were asked to solve
      the problem. The low temporal resolution of fMRI, however, makes it impossible
      to dissociate activity associated with the sign from activity associated with
      operands in these problems. Therefore, they were simply designed to be filler
      trials.2There was a tendency for a correlation between grade and activity associated
      with addition sign-only trials (versus fixation) in the right hippocampus (r\_=\_0.29,
      p\_=\_0.09; BF10\_=\_0.82), but no correlation for baseline sign-only trials
      (versus fixation) (r\_=\_\u22120.10, p\_=\_0.58; BF10\_=\_0.25). Thus, the correlation

      to adopt the perspectives of others is fundamental to effective communication
      in social interactions. However, the neural correlates of allocentric thinking
      in communicative signaling remain unclear. We adapted a novel signaling task
      in which the signaler was given the target word and must choose a one-word signal
      to help the receiver guess the target. Behavioral results suggest that speakers
      can use allocentric thinking to choose signals that are salient from the perspective
      of the receiver rather than their own point of view. At the neural level, functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data reveal that the medial prefrontal cortex
      (mPFC), ventral striatum, and temporal-parietal junction are more activated
      when signalers engage in allocentric than egocentric thinking. Moreover, functional
      connectivity between the mPFC and ventral striatum predicted individuals perspective-taking
      ability during successful communication. These findings reveal that neural representations
      in the mPFC-striatum network support perspective-taking in complex social decision
      making, providing a new perspective on how the brain arbitrates between allocentric
      thinking and egocentric thinking in communication and social coordination.Previous

      successfully with another agent requires the ability to take that person''s
      perspective into account, so as to decide how to choose the most effective cues
      to send and how to correctly interpret signals received. The perspective-taking
      ability to know what others know (and, hence, what is mutually known) plays
      a fundamental role in message formulation and comprehension (Clark, 1985; Clark
      and Marshall, 1981; Glucksberg and Krauss, 1967; Krauss and Fussell, 1991; Ritter,
      1979; Rosenberg and Cohen, 1964). Grice (1975) proposed that conversational
      inferences are made possible by implicit agreements between speakers and listeners.
      In the Gricean cooperative principle, speakers utterances have to deliver the
      most relevant information on the topic of discussion in order to reduce the
      potential interference in the listeners inferential processes (Grice, 1957,
      1969; Grice, 1975). Namely, when speakers choose a particular word, they should
      adopt the perspective of their conversational partner to reduce referential
      ambiguity (Sperber and Wilson, 1995). Following Grice''s initial framework,
      a Rational Speech Act theory further posited that rational speakers should maximize
      the social utility of providing epistemic help to a listener (Goodman and Frank,
      2016). This is especially true when a particular event or object is being denoted
      during a conversation, a process called referential communication (Glucksberg
      et al., 1975; Krauss and Fussell, 1991; Wardlow, 2013).During referential communication,
      the signaler has a target meaning to convey and needs to send a signal that
      represents that meaning. The receiver, on the other hand, must infer the target
      meaning from the signal. A block to successful communication can happen as a
      signal that is salient/informative to the signaler is not necessarily so to
      the receiver, and vice versa (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). For example, the signaler
      may associate the target bank with cue money (a salient feature of the bank),
      but sending a signal representing money may not help the receiver to guess the
      word bank because bank is not a salient feature of money. Instead, to communicate
      adequately, the signaler may send a signal representing teller to help the receiver
      think of bank, even when the signaler may not strongly associate bank with teller
      (Nelson et al., 2004; Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). The knowledge of the patterns
      of salience between words provides a common ground between parties to communicate
      effectively without prior interactions with each other (Clark, 1996; Levinson,
      2006; Lewis, 1969; Nelson et al., 2004; Rosenberg and Cohen, 1964; Ryskin et
      al., 2015; Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). Effective communication requires individuals
      to use common ground information and to suppress the tendency to use private
      information (Bgels et al., 2015). Lewis (1969) posited a game-theoretic account
      of coordination indicating that salient aspects of world knowledge allow people
      to coordinate in the absence of convention. For example, the speakers might
      utter a word that is strongly connected with the referent to assist listeners
      in narrowing the possible referents that they will infer after hearing that
      word. Although several theories have proposed that the use of perspective-taking
      (e.g., inhibit egocentric perspective and adopt allocentric perspective) boots
      successful communication between two persons (e.g., Clark and Murphy, 1982;
      Grice, 1975; Levinson, 2006; Sperber and Wilson, 1995), empirical evidence regarding
      how people flexibly switch their perspectives (i.e., egocentric vs. allocentric)
      in word selection during communicative coordination is still lacking. Moreover,
      the neural basis of how speakers coordinate their communicative goal with others
      by taking the perspective of the person receiving the signal remains not well
      understood.A variety of referential communication tasks have been implemented
      to study the extent to which listeners are able to interpret the meaning of
      the signal by inferring others intention and belief (also known as mentalizing)
      (Apperly et al., 2010; Barr, 2008; Dumontheil et al., 2010a; Frank and Goodman,
      2012; Hanna et al., 2003; Keysar et al., 2000, 2003; Krauss and Glucksberg,
      1977; Sidera et al., 2018). A widely-used task in this area is the director
      task in which a director gives instructions to move objects around in a grid,
      some of which are only seen by the participants (listeners) but not by the director
      (Keysar et al., 2000). In order to be successful in selecting the target object,
      listeners need to correctly infer which objects are invisible from the speakers
      perspective and inhibit their own perspective accordingly. Researchers using
      this task showed that listeners were biased to their own egocentric perspective,
      i.e., participants looked longer at and reached more for an object which was
      only visible to themselves than the one observed by both parties (Apperly et
      al., 2010; Keysar, 2007, 2003; Lin et al., 2010). Neuroimaging studies with
      this task found activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and middle temporal
      gyri (MTG) when participants were required to take into account the perspective
      of the director (Dumontheil et al., 2010b; Hillebrandt et al., 2013). The mPFC
      is involved in the mentalizing network (Molenberghs et al., 2016; Schurz et
      al., 2014), while MTG is related to the recognition of faces (Acheson and Hagoort,
      2013; Singer et al., 2004). Another study also found that adolescents who were
      better in social perspective-taking usage during the director task had thinner
      cerebral cortex in the regions of middle frontal gyrus and the lateral parietal
      lobe (Tamnes et al., 2018), suggesting that frontal-parietal regions account
      for individual difference in perspective-taking. However, this line of research
      mainly focused on how individuals interpret others instructions in order to
      navigate the visual world. Whether and how individuals spontaneously choose
      signals that help listeners to better decode the signal correctly and effectively
      remains unclear.The mPFC and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) have been implicated
      repeatedly in mentalizing tasks which often involve the prediction of what the
      other person might think or feel in hypothetical situations using story vignettes
      and cartoons (Aichhorn et al., 2006; Castelli et al., 2000; Molenberghs et al.,
      2016; Schurz et al., 2014). These regions are also found to differentiate different
      aspects of mental states during cooperation versus competition in social games
      (Tsoi et al., 2016). In addition, neuroimaging studies using social interactive
      games that require iterative reasoning about people''s minds, such as the Beauty
      Contest game (Coricelli and Nagel, 2009), Patent Race game (Zhu et al., 2012),
      and Stag Hunt game (Yoshida et al., 2010), also found that the mPFC is involved
      in the inferential processes during strategic reasoning. The mPFC has been shown
      to dissociate between subjects with different levels (i.e., high versus low)
      of strategic reasoning in the Beauty Contest game, suggesting that mPFC implements
      more high-level strategic thinking when inferring other players thoughts (Coricelli
      and Nagel, 2009).In addition to these key mentalizing regions, the striatum
      is also implicated in strategic thinking in social contexts. The striatum has
      long been shown to encode reward prediction error signals in reinforcement learning
      tasks (Daniel and Pollmann, 2014; Garrison et al., 2013; Liljeholm and O''Doherty,
      2012), such as representing and resolving the mismatch between expected rewards
      and actual outcomes (Garrison et al., 2013; Pagnoni et al., 2002). In social
      tasks, striatal activation has also been observed in social learning and implicated
      in social prediction error and belief updating (Behrens et al., 2008; Hampton
      et al., 2008; Hertz et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2012). There
      is evidence that the frontostriatal circuit is a part of the neural architecture
      which facilitates executive functions, and is implicated in behavioral flexibility,
      adaptation to changes, and high-order decision-making (Alexander et al., 1986;
      Chudasama and Robbins, 2006; Gerraty et al., 2018; Seo et al., 2012). During
      social interactions, the simultaneous representations of one''s own and others
      intentions and beliefs may lead to social conflicts and thus require executive
      control to flexibly switch between appropriate perspectives. Therefore, such
      a process may engage the frontostriatal network to reduce social conflict and
      make decisions.Interestingly, the TPJ is not consistently shown in the contrast
      of high versus low levels of social strategic thinking (Coricelli and Nagel,
      2009; Nagel et al., 2018). One possibility is that the TPJ represents the cognitive
      aspect of the theory of mind (ToM; Apperly and Butterfill, 2009; Frith and Frith,
      2008; Premack and Woodruff, 1978), whereas mPFC registers the motivational aspect
      of ToM, which is more required in goal-directed interactive social situations
      (Koster-Hale et al., 2017; Molenberghs et al., 2016; Schurz et al., 2014). However,
      most of the previously mentioned social decision-making studies use mainly turn-based
      cooperative or competitive games in which participants need to consider others
      perspectives in order to make plans for the next step and therefore self and
      other perspective thinking are not necessarily in conflict as they occur sequentially.
      The experimental designs do not allow specific examination of the self-other
      viewpoint conflict resolution process, which is a critical component of strategic
      ToM.Here, to examine whether and how people solve the conflict between self
      and other perspectives spontaneously to promote successful communication, we
      adapted a novel signaling task in which the signaler was given a target word
      and needed to choose a response from a list of cue words to maximize the chance
      that the receiver guessed the target correctly (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). This
      online communicative task provides an ecologically valid measure of social decision-making.
      Research has shown that every two words have associative strengths (AS) in natural
      language understanding (Deese, 1959; Nelson et al., 2000). Moreover, the AS
      between a word pair is directional, that is, we can differentiate between a
      forward associative strength (target-to-cue; egocentrically salient) and backward
      associative strength (cue-to-target; allocentrically salient). In the current
      study, the salient patterns of the forward and backward AS between words were
      manipulated in each trial. Optimal performance in this task requires the signaler
      to choose from the perspective of the partner (i.e., responding relied on the
      backward AS) rather than from his/her own perspective (i.e., responding relied
      on the forward AS). Specifically, if a signaler is successful at taking other''s
      perspective, the signaler has to take into account the backward AS rather than
      the forward AS when communicating the meaning of the target word.To specify
      the brain activity related to this type of allocentric thinking most likely
      used in speakers goal-directed communicative behavior and differentiate it from
      instances where referential communication is not required, we introduced two
      other conditions that did not require communication. The first one was the matching
      condition in which both parties could see the target word and participants were
      asked to just match others responses by selecting the cue that others were likely
      to choose. No transmission of information was required to achieve the coordinative
      goal in this condition (so-called non-communicative coordination). The other
      one was the solo condition in which participants played the game solely and
      were asked to choose the response that was most salient to themselves. Of the
      three conditions (i.e., signaling, matching, solo), the signaling condition
      was the most challenging as it required perspective-taking. In the matching
      condition, the asymmetries of salience between cues would not necessarily hinder
      the success of coordination between two individuals, as we expected both to
      use the same salient point of view (forward AS for both players) to solve the
      problem (Chowdhury et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 1994). In contrast, the signaler
      and receiver in the signaling condition worked in opposite direction: the signaler
      had to select a cue to convey the meaning of a target word to the receiver and
      the receiver must infer the word from the cue. To do so successfully, the signaler
      must inhibit his/her salient perspective (from target-to-cue) and adopt the
      receiver''s perspective (from cue-to-target).Therefore, the current design allowed
      us to examine whether participants were able to adjust their perspectives as
      they transition from a non-communicative task in which the goal was to match
      the response with other people (the matching condition) to a communicative task
      in which the goal was to send a signal to help the listener to guess the target
      word (the signaling condition) given differing patterns of salience among words.
      The solo condition served as the non-social baseline as there was no need to
      think about others in this condition. By combining the novel signaling task
      with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined the neural
      basis of speakers egocentric thinking and allocentric thinking in word selection
      during different contexts, such as communicative coordination and non-communicative
      coordination. Our study also examined how both forward and backward associative
      strengths are encoded in the brain, which allowed us to assess the strength
      of egocentric and allocentric coding. We predicted that the mPFC and ventral
      striatum would be recruited in the allocentric thinking process when selecting
      a signal with a communicative goal. Given the anatomical connections between
      mPFC and striatum, and their shared role in social learning, we further predicted
      that the coupling between the two regions plays an important role in allocentric
      thinking.2. Methods2.1. ParticipantsThirty paid volunteers (12 women; mean age  SD,
      23.02  2.59 years) participated in the fMRI study. All participants were right-handed
      native speakers of English with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None of
      the participants suffered from psychiatric or neurological disorders or any
      hearing or language disorders. Participants were given Singapore dollar (S)20
      (approximately S1 = US0.73) for showing up and an extra monetary bonus based
      on performance in the tasks. All participants provided informed consent and
      completed the session based on the protocol that was approved by the National
      University of Singapore Institutional Review Board.2.2. Design and materialsOne
      hundred and eight sets of words were selected by a pretest (see the following
      session). According to the word association norms, there are two salient patterns
      of word association between words: the associative strength from a target word
      to a cue word is identified as forward AS, which is an egocentric point of view
      (salience from one''s own point of view, self-POV); whereas the associative
      strength from a cue word to a target word is recognized as backward AS, which
      is acknowledged as an allocentric point of view (salience from the other''s
      point of view, other-POV) (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). In each trial, one target
      word and three cue words were shown to participants. These three cue words had
      varied associative strengths with the target word. For each cue in the current
      study, we calculated its associative strengths with the target word from a large
      subject pool (see the pretest) that included direct forward strength (target-to-cue)
      and reverse backward strength (cue-to-target).It is worth noting that the direction
      of mutual salience between word pairs captured by the association norms may
      be asymmetric. For example, the top forward associate of day is night (target-to-cue:
      forward AS = 0.819), and the top backward associate of night is day (cue-to-target;
      AS = 0.686). Demonstrably, the patterns of salience between the target day and
      cue night are symmetrically high. In contrast, a cue week is not a salient feature
      of the target day. When people think of day, they are less likely to think of
      week. The target day does not strongly associate with the cue week (forward
      AS = 0.022) whereas the cue week strongly triggers the target day (backward
      AS = 0.473). Therefore, the patterns of salience between the target day and
      the cue week are asymmetrically high. These high and low examples were selected
      from Nelson et al. (2004).The asymmetries imply a difference in perspective:
      what is salient from the speaker''s point of view may not be salient from the
      listener''s point of view. To enable coordination between a speaker and a listener,
      people should have a conceptual understanding of the dissociation between self
      and others perspectives and successfully use the right perspective to guide
      their communication in different contexts. Therefore, we aimed to use the asymmetric
      saliences between the target word and cue word to capture speakers perspective-taking
      ability in a novel signaling task. Individuals should have common knowledge
      of the patterns of salience in word association and select a salient word to
      convey the meaning of a target to boost referential communication success. To
      do this, we filtered the one-word targets to ensure that each one could go along
      with at least two cues with opposite salient features. Specifically, the cues
      used in each trial included a word with high forward/low backward (HFLB) AS
      that was more salient from one''s own point of view, a word with low forward/high
      backward (LFHB) AS that was more salient from other''s point of view, and a
      word with low forward/low backward (LFLB) AS as an option to detect whether
      the participant was engaged in the task (see Fig. 1A). The mean forward AS and
      backward AS values for the three types of cues across all trials in each condition
      are listed in Table S1.Download : Download high-res image (307KB)Download :

      In each trial, participants were presented with a target word and three types
      of cues based on their association with the target word. Specifically, the cues
      used in each trial included a word with high forward/low backward (HFLB) AS
      that was salient from one''s own point of view, a word with low forward/high
      backward (LFHB) AS that was salient from other''s point of view, and a word
      with low forward/low backward (LFLB) AS as an option to detect whether the participant
      was engaged in the task. B, Task procedure and stimulus examples. Participants
      were asked to select one cue from a list tied to a specific target in three
      experimental conditions: (1) Signaling condition: help your partner guess the
      target; (2) Matching condition: match your response with your partner; (3) Solo
      condition: choose the first word that comes to mind. Participants were told
      to make a response within 10 s in each trial. Three trials of the same game
      type were presented consecutively as a mini block, followed by a long ITI (i.e.,
      a fixation crosshair) for 14 s, with the order of the mini blocks counterbalanced
      across participants.In the current study, we also focused on whether people
      were able to switch their perspective from self to other in communicative coordination
      rather than in non-communicative coordination or the solo condition. Therefore,
      participants were asked to select one cue from a list tied to a specific target
      in three experimental conditions: a non-coordinating condition (i.e. solo condition)
      as a non-strategic baseline and two types of coordinating conditions (communicative
      coordination and non-communicative coordination). We randomly divided all word
      sets into three experimental conditions, resulting in 36 unique word sets for
      each condition. The solo condition required participants to choose the first
      word that came to mind based on the list of three cue options. As for the non-communicative
      coordinating condition (i.e., matching condition), participants and their partners
      had to coordinate by independently selecting the same cue response given the
      target word in each trial. In the communicative coordinative condition (i.e.,
      signaling condition), participants were given the target word and had to select
      a cue to help their partner guess the target.2.3. AS evaluation (pretest)We
      used two word-association databases to construct the word-sets for our study.
      The first database was the University of South Florida Free Association Norms
      (USF; Nelson et al., 2004) from which data was taken for only normed pairs.
      This database contained a total of 63,619 cue-target pairs. The second database
      was the Small World of Words English (De Deyne et al., 2019) with 209,022 word-pairs
      and their association strengths.Both datasets consisted of target-cue pairs
      and their forward and backward association strengths. Forward association strength
      from target to cue was = P(cue|target), whereas the backward association strength
      from cue to target was = P(target|cue). We then sought to label target-cue pairs
      according to how high or low their forward/backward association strengths were.
      To define cutoffs for high and low, we looked at the distribution of all target-cue
      pair association strengths (separate distributions for forward and backward
      association strengths) and took certain limits as indicative of high or low
      association. For the USF word list, any association strengths below the 30th
      percentile were taken as low whereas those above the 70th percentile were taken
      as high. For the Small World of Words database, low was set at or below 10th
      percentile and high was set at or above 90th percentile. In this way, a target-cue
      pair was labeled according to its forward and backward association strengths.
      For example, a target-cue pair that had both high forward and high backward
      associations was labeled as HFHB, whereas another one with low forward and high
      backward strengths was labeled as LFHB. We then selected target words with three
      target-cue pair labels that fit the requirements of our study. Specifically,
      we chose target words that had HFLB, LFHB, and LFLB target-cue pairs available.
      When there were more than three target-cue pairs available, we used the one
      with the highest forward association value in the case of HFLB and the highest
      backward association value in the case of LFHB association. This gave us a set
      of 4 words: 1 target and 3 cues (i.e., three target-cue pairs in one word-set).
      From the word lists of the University of South Florida and Small World of Words,
      we retrieved a total of 251 sets and 833 sets respectively, giving us a total
      of 1084 word sets.We then recruited participants from Amazon''s Mechanical Turk
      service (MTurk; Buhrmester et al., 2011) to reevaluate the association ratings
      for all target-cue pairs (both forward and backward) that had been selected.
      This gave us an index of absolute association between words as opposed to the
      relative association (as was obtained from the word databases). Essentially,
      we presented MTurk workers with a target-cue pair and asked them to rate how
      much the first word brings to mind the second word, using a scale of 0-100 anchored
      at 0, 13, 25, 38, 50, 63, 75, 88 and 100. There was a total of 499 MTurk workers
      with mean age = 35.3 (SD = 9.83, 289 females) with each rating an average of
      150 target-cue pairs (on average, the same rating question was answered by 11
      workers). Participants rated all 3 target-cue pairs for any word-set in both
      forward and backward directions. The assignment of word-set and sequence of
      presentation of word-pairs were randomized across participants. We used data
      from raters who had at least an overall duration of 400 s in rating the entire
      list of 150 word-pairs (i.e. taking at least 2.6 s on average to rate each target-cue
      pair). We then took the average of evocation ratings for each target-cue pair
      to obtain an average evocation rating. Finally, the 1084 word-sets were ranked
      by the sum of AS differences for HFLB (participants average rating on High Forward
      minus Low Backward) and LFHB (High Backward minus Low Forward) cue words. The
      108 sets of words with the highest AS differences were selected.2.4. ProcedureOur
      experimental task is illustrated in Fig. 1B. Each participant underwent fMRI
      scanning while performing a total of 108 trials of the game. During scanning,
      the subject viewed a projection of a computer screen and gave a button response
      with the index, middle, and ring fingers of the right hand. Participants were
      told that the study involved three games: (1) choose the first word that comes
      to mind (for solo condition); (2) match your response with your partner (for
      matching condition); (3) help your partner guess the target (for signaling condition).
      Specifically, in the solo condition, participants were told that they had to
      choose the first word (out of the three options) that came to their mind given
      the target word for each trial and they would be given a fixed bonus (S2) regardless
      of their performance. In the matching condition, participants were told that
      in each trial they would be randomly paired with one other person who had taken
      part in this game with the same sets of words before them, and none of them
      knew whom they would be paired with. In addition, participants were instructed
      that the aim of the game was to coordinate or match their choices with that
      of their partners and their partners were also asked to do so. To increase the
      participants motivation to match their responses with their respective partners,
      participants were informed that both players would receive an extra 20 cents
      for every choice that matched, and the maximum bonus across trials was S7.2.
      In the signaling condition, participants were asked to communicate effectively
      with their partners, and they were informed that there were two different roles
      in the game. Participants were assigned the role of signalers, while their partners
      who had taken part in the game with the same sets of words played as receivers.
      In each trial, the participant as a signaler had to choose a cue word from the
      list to convey the meaning of the target word to the receiver. In terms of communication
      success, the receiver must infer the meaning from the cue to decipher the target
      word. Participants were informed that both communicators would be rewarded 20
      cents if the word they chose led their partner to successfully guess the given
      target word in a trial (previously) and the maximum bonus across trials was
      S7.2. Unbeknownst to the participants until the end of the study, in reality,
      there was no pairing of participants in the matching and signaling condition.Trials
      started with a fixation inter-trial interval (ITI) of 1.5-3.5 s (jittered),
      after which a game appeared. On each trial, participants would see the instruction
      of the game on top of the screen and a target word was shown at the center of
      the screen along with three cues. When given the target word, participants were
      asked to select a cue from the list based on the instruction shown in each trial.
      In addition, participants were told that they should avoid choosing the word
      strictly from their personal life, and instead, they should make the choice
      based on shared world knowledge, the knowledge that most people would know.
      In order to give the participants enough time to think about their choices and
      conduct the experiment within the time constraint of the scanner, participants
      were told to make a response within 10 s, beyond which the stimuli would disappear
      without recording any response. The positions (left/middle/right) of the three
      types of cues (i.e. Word LFHB, Word HFLB, and Word LFLB) were counterbalanced
      across trials. In an effort to ensure that participants considered all possible
      responses to each question probed and reduce cross-trial habituation of the
      neural responses, the order of trials was pseudo-randomly determined for each
      participant: three trials of the same game type were presented consecutively
      as a mini block, followed by a long ITI (i.e., a fixation crosshair) for 14
      s. The mini blocks of the three game types were presented sequentially for each
      participant and the order of the presentation of the three game types was counterbalanced
      across participants. Additionally, the order of the word sets in every three
      trials of the same game type was randomized across participants.We did not provide
      any feedback to the participants in between trials. Before scanning, all participants
      received a written instruction about the experimental procedure and completed
      a practice session on a computer with another selected sets of words that were
      not used in the formal study to ensure comprehension of the game.2.5. Behavioral
      data analysisFor each experimental condition, task response was acquired and
      reaction time (RT) was measured. Prior to computing the mean percentage and
      RT of each choice, we omitted trials with reaction time less than 400 ms, which
      were rare. To examine perspective-taking in each condition, we focused on the
      difference between the self-POV option and the other-POV option by taking the
      proportion of participants choosing the Word HFLB to subtract the proportion
      of choosing the Word LFHB. We conducted a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA to
      analyze the self-other perspective differences for the three conditions, using
      the condition (i.e. solo, matching, and signaling) as the within-subject variable,
      and the proportion of individual''s choice difference between Word HFLB and
      Word LFHB as a dependent variable. In addition, a two-way repeated-measures
      ANOVA was conducted using the condition (solo, matching, and signaling) and
      the word perspective (Word HFLB and Word LFHB) as independent factors and the
      mean RT to make the choice as the dependent variable. In these analyses, the
      Greenhouse-Geisser corrected degrees of freedom for non-sphericity was applied
      where appropriate. Multiple comparisons were controlled using the Bonferroni
      correction.We further investigated the relationship between the coordinative
      effect across different conditions. In the solo and matching condition, the
      coordinative effect was calculated using the frequency of choosing the Word
      HFLB minus the frequency of choosing the Word LFHB; while in the signaling condition,
      the coordinative effect was identified in an opposite way using the frequency
      of choosing the Word LFHB minus the frequency of choosing the Word HFLB. Because
      the normality assumption is violated (as revealed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests),
      Spearman rank-order correlation analysis was used. To show the robustness of
      the correlation results, outliers that were either 1.5 times the interquartile
      range or more above the third quartile or 1.5 times the interquartile range
      or more below the first quartile of the data in each condition were removed.
      This resulted in one participant''s data being removed.Because responses to
      our novel signaling task were presumed to be based on forward and backward salience,
      we further tested whether individuals responses could be predicted by the associative
      strengths between the target words and the cue words. For example, in the signaling
      condition, high backward AS may be positively correlated with the proportion
      of participants choosing Word LFHB across the trials. Hence, the relationship
      between the associative strength and participants choice was analyzed with generalized
      linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) with the LME4 package in R statistical software
      (version 3.6.1; R Core Team, 2019). Binomial mixed-effects regressions with
      the target word treated as a random intercept were performed separately for
      each type of games as in the previous study (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). Using
      mixed-effects models, we were able to take into account the variability in word
      items (Baayen et al., 2008; Barr et al., 2013; Bates et al., 2015). See supplementary
      for another regression model that included subjects and word items as the random
      intercepts. All data (as well as the R scripts for GLMM analyses) are available
      at the Open Science Framework (OSF) https://osf.io/w6khb.2.6. fMRI data acquisitionImaging
      was performed on a Siemens PRISMA 3T MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany)
      with a 32-channel head coil at the Clinical Imaging Research Centre of the National
      University of Singapore. Functional images were collected using a 2-dimensional
      multiband single-shot T2*-weighted, echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (78 slices,
      2 mm-thickness; TR = 1000 ms; TE = 31.40 ms; flip angle = 60; FOV = 220 mm;
      matrix size = 88  88; voxel size: 2.5  2.5  2.0 mm3) with a multi-band acceleration
      factor of 6 covering the entire brain in the oblique axial plane. A high resolution
      (1.0  1.0  1.0 mm3) T1-weighted MPRAGE anatomical image (TR = 2300 ms; TE =
      2.22 ms; flip angle = 8; 1 mm-thickness) was acquired for registration and normalization
      of functional data to the standard brain. The total acquisition time for MPRAGE
      is 4 min and 52 s. Head padding was used for each subject to minimize head motion,
      and headphones and earplugs were used to dampen the scanner noise.2.7. fMRI
      data analysisQuality control was done with the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC,
      version 0.15.2) (Esteban et al., 2017). The signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., snr)
      in our data ranged from 4.30 to 5.40. Mean framewise displacement (FD) and temporal
      derivative of the voxel time course variance (DVARS) were used as the main quality
      control measures for the functional imaging data (Power et al., 2012). FD is
      a data quality index expressing instantaneous head-motion based on change in
      head position across frames. DVARS is another quality index that estimates the
      rate of change of BOLD signal across the whole brain at each frame. Participants
      were excluded if the mean FD value for one run exceeded 0.3 mm (fd_mean from
      MRIQC), or if the DVARS was more than 6% BOLD signal change (DVARS_nstd from
      MRIQC of over 60). No participants were excluded based on this standard.We preprocessed
      and analyzed fMRI data using SPM12 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). The first eight
      volumes were discarded due to unsteady magnetization. To correct for head-motion,
      the remaining volumes were realigned spatially to the first non-discarded volume.
      Images were then re-sliced to obtain a mean image. The anatomical image was
      then co-registered to the mean functional image after motion correction and
      segmentation, generating parameters for normalization. All volumes were subsequently
      normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and resampled
      to 2  2  2 mm3 isotropic voxel. The normalized functional images were then spatially
      smoothed with Gaussian kernel with 8 mm FWHM. Lastly, we applied a high-pass
      temporal filter with a cutoff of 128 s to remove low-frequency drifts.After
      preprocessing, statistical analysis of the event-related fMRI signals was performed
      for each participant using the general linear model (GLM) (Friston et al., 1994).
      In our task, each trial consisted of one event aligned to the presentation of
      the three cue options with the target word. To dissociate the fMRI activity
      for different trials, regressors were constructed by convolving the canonical
      hemodynamic response function (HRF) at the time of response with zero duration.
      This is the juncture whereby participants made their choices. The first-level
      GLM design matrix was made up of six regressors of interest: the combinations
      of three game types (solo, matching, and signaling conditions) and two participants
      choices (choosing Word LFHB and choosing Word HFLB). As participants made the
      choices based on their own beliefs, the number of trials was a bit different
      across six regressors (mean trial  SD for Matching HFLB: 19  4; Matching LFHB:
      15  5; Signaling HFLB: 15  6; Signaling LFHB: 19  6; Solo HFLB: 21  4; Solo
      LFHB: 13  4). As the word choice reflected the perspective that participants
      were taking (self-POV or other-POV), the current model allowed us to investigate:
      the neural differences between the other-POV and self-POV choice within each
      condition (i.e. Signaling LFHB vs. Signaling HFLB, Matching LFHB vs. Matching
      HFLB and Solo LFHB vs. Solo HFLB). All regressors were further modulated by
      a parametric modulator containing the difference between the forward and backward
      associative strengths of the chosen option. The aim of testing the modulator
      effect was to investigate whether and how the brain responded to the degree
      of salience between forward and backward AS across different situations in a
      quantitative way. In addition, the six scan-to-scan motion parameters produced
      during realignment were included as additional regressors in the GLM to account
      for residual motion effects. The contrasts of the first-level analysis were
      entered into a one-sample t-test for the second-level group analysis conducted
      with a random effect statistical model.To assess the functional connectivity
      among regions in the signaling conditions, we conducted generalized psychophysiological
      interaction (gPPI) analyses with a gPPI toolbox (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/gppi)
      to examine the covariation between the neural activities in two brain areas
      (McLaren et al., 2012). We were particularly interested in the brain areas that
      showed variation of functional connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex
      during the signaling condition. The seed regions were created using a 6-mm diameter
      sphere at the left (peak coordinate MNI: x, y, z = -8, 44, -2) and right of
      mPFC (peak coordinate MNI: x, y, z = 2, 42, 8) as identified in the whole-brain
      analysis while comparing the word LFHB with the word HFLB in the signaling condition.
      For completeness, we also ran two additional gPPI analyses with the contrasts
      of Word LFHB vs. Word HFLB in the matching condition and solo condition.At the
      first-level analysis, we first extracted the de-convolved time series within
      the seed region as the physiological regressor. We then define all regressors
      in the designed GLM as the psychological regressors. These two terms were multiplied
      as the PPI regressors. All these regressors were convolved with the canonical
      hemodynamic response function to model the BOLD signal. In addition, six head-motion
      parameters were included as covariates to account for residual motion effects.
      We further carried out whole-brain regression analyses between gPPI connectivity
      estimates and the mean coordinative effect based on participants choice. The
      contrasts between the PPI regressors (e.g., word LFHB vs. word HFLB in the signaling
      condition) for each participant were used at the second-level analysis with
      their corresponding behavioral index as a covariate (e.g., choosing the Word
      LFHB - choosing the Word HFLB in the signaling condition).To correct for multiple
      comparisons, results were obtained at a voxel-level height threshold of p <
      0.005 and survived after cluster-level family-wise error correction (FWE) at
      p < 0.05. In addition, small volume correction (SVC) with FWE corrected p-value
      (p < 0.05) was used on a priori regions of interest previously implicated in
      mentalizing and interpersonal strategic thinking: medial prefrontal cortex (MNI,
      x, y, z =  3, 51, -9 mm) (Coricelli and Nagel, 2009), temporo-parietal junction
      (x, y, z =  52, -30, 10 mm) (Schurz et al., 2014), ventral striatum (x, y, z
      =  10, 10, -6 mm) (Yoshida et al., 2010), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (x,
      y, z =  6, 30, 42 mm) (Nagel et al., 2018). Spherical search space with 8 mm
      radius was defined surrounding the independently defined coordinates reported
      above. For display purposes, all contrast images are depicted at p < 0.005,
      uncorrected. All results are available on Neurovault (Gorgolewski et al., 2015);
      see https://identifiers.org/neurovault.collection:9096.3. Results3.1. Behavioral
      resultsAlthough participants were free to make their own decisions by choosing
      any options provided, the Word LFLB was rarely chosen. The proportions of participants
      choosing the Word LFLB in three conditions were low, as would be expected (mean  SD,
      Solo: 0.056  0.043; Matching: 0.057  0.041; Signaling: 0.038  0.038), providing
      evidence that participants were able to identify the strongly associated cues
      with the target word across trials and continued to be engaged in the tasks
      throughout the experiment.Our first analysis on the proportion of participants
      choosing the Word HFLB (self-POV) minus the proportion of participants choosing
      the Word LFHB (other-POV) revealed a significant main effect (F(2, 58) = 18.234,
      p < 0.001, p2= 0.385; Fig. 2A) for the condition. Our post-hoc analysis found
      that the mean choice difference in the signaling condition (mean = -0.105, 95%
      CI [-0.193, -0.018]) was significantly lower than that in the matching condition
      (mean = 0.092, 95% CI [0.024, 0.160], p = 0.001) and the solo condition (mean
      = 0.205, 95% CI [0.136, 0.0.275], p < 0.001), with these latter conditions having
      no significant difference between them (p = 0.101). These results suggest that
      participants did use the allocentric perspective to convey the message in the
      signaling condition. Our findings support the idea that people are able to differentiate
      the salient patterns between egocentric and allocentric perspective in different
      word pairs and flexibly switch the perspective from self to other to select
      the optimal signal.Download : Download high-res image (279KB)Download : Download

      between the self-POV option and the other-POV option (the proportion of choosing
      the Word HFLB minus the proportion of choosing the Word LFHB) as a function
      of condition (solo, matching, and signaling). B, Mean reaction time as a function
      of condition (solo, matching, and signaling) and word perspective (choosing
      Word LFHB and choosing Word HFLB). The violin plots indicate the density of
      the sample distribution across the y-values. Error bars represent within-subject
      95% CIs.A two-way repeated measures ANOVA on the mean reaction time found no
      significant two-way interaction effect between the condition and the word perspective
      (F(2, 58) = 0.081, p = 0.922, p2 = 0.003, Fig. 2B), and no significant main
      effect for the word perspective (F(1, 29) = 1.393, p = 0.248, p2 = 0.046). However,
      a significant main effect for the condition (F(1.477, 42.843) = 30.055, p <
      0.001, p2 = 0.509) was observed. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the RT in the
      signaling condition (mean = 4.741, 95% CI [4.593, 4.889]) was longer than that
      in the matching condition (mean = 4.465, 95% CI [4.369, 4.561], p = 0.007) and
      in the solo condition (mean = 4.067, 95% CI [3.928, 4.207], p < 0.001). In addition,
      participants decision-making was observably slower in the matching condition
      than the solo condition (p < 0.001). The slower responses in the signaling condition
      indicated that coordination in a communicative context involves more complex
      inferential processing in general.Additionally, correlation tests were conducted
      to examine the relationships of the coordinative effect among the three conditions.
      Spearman''s correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between
      the coordinative effects in the matching condition (HFLB - LFHB) and the signaling
      condition (LFHB - HFLB) (rs = -0.422, p = 0.023, n = 29), suggesting that taking
      the perspectives from one''s point of view in a non-communicative task may impede
      an individual from switching to others point of view in a communicative task.
      We also found that the coordinative effect in the solo condition was marginally
      correlated with that in the matching condition (rs = 0.357, p = 0.058, n = 29)
      but not correlated with that in the signaling condition (rs = -0.313, p = 0.098,
      n = 29).To statistically examine whether and how the proportion of participants
      choosing each cue was predicted by the salient patterns of egocentric and/or
      allocentric perspective in different situations, binomial mixed-effects regressions
      were performed separately for each type of games (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). For
      each condition, the model included the forward and backward AS as fixed effects
      and the count of participants choosing each type of cues as the dependent variable.
      The two continuous independent variables were centered on zero and scaled as
      the model required. We included a random intercept for target word. In a first
      step, we fitted a null model in which we only put the random effect of the target
      word. In the second step, the fixed effects (forward and backward AS of the
      chosen word) were added to the models. In a final step, the interactions between
      the fixed effects were added to a new model. The Akaike information criterion
      (AIC) was used to compare the models, with and without interaction terms, between
      the fixed effects. Specifically, the model with lower AIC was considered to
      have a better model fit. The results showed that models with interaction terms
      were better than models without interaction terms for all models of three game
      types (model fit for the matching condition: AIC = 1237, 2(1) = 33.731, p <
      0.001; solo condition: AIC = 1027, 2(1) = 4.388, p = 0.036; signaling condition:
      AIC = 944.29, 2(1) = 10.455, p = 0.001).Therefore, we focused on the models
      with interaction terms between forward and backward AS for each condition. In
      the signaling condition, parameter estimates indicated that there were significant
      main effects for forward AS ( = 0.646, SE = 0.058, z = 11.124, p < 0.001) and
      backward AS ( = 0.854, SE = 0.061, z = 13.983, p < 0.001). Through the comparison
      of the model parameters, it showed that the main effect of forward AS was smaller
      than that of backward AS in the signaling condition. Moreover, the two-way interaction
      between forward and backward AS significantly affected participants choice (
      = -0.214, SE = 0.066, z = -3.225, p = 0.001). This finding suggests that backward
      AS had larger effect on participants choice when forward AS was low (see Fig.
      3A). For the matching condition, we found significant main effects for forward
      AS ( = 0.816, SE = 0.064, z = 12.795, p < 0.001) and backward AS ( = 0.649,
      SE = 0.072, z = 9.027, p < 0.001), and also found a significant interaction
      effect ( = -0.416, SE = 0.072, z = -5.752, p < 0.001), suggesting that the backward
      AS had much weaker effect when forward AS was high (see Fig. 3B). For the solo
      condition, we found significant main effects for forward AS ( = 1.110, SE =
      0.070, z = 15.789, p < 0.001) and backward AS ( = 0.321, SE = 0.082, z = 3.913,
      p < 0.001), and a significant interaction effect ( = -0.166, SE = 0.081, z =
      -2.048, p = 0.041) was also observed, suggesting that backward AS only showed
      weak effect when forward AS was low (see Fig. 3C). A comparison of the model
      parameters showed that the main effect of forward AS was larger than that of
      backward AS in the matching condition and solo condition, suggesting that choices
      in these two conditions were mainly influenced by forward AS.Download : Download

      in each condition. Model fit for the proportion of signalers selecting each
      cue, including an interaction between backward and forward associative strengths
      (AS, values were rescaled). A, In the signaling condition, there was a strong
      backward AS effect on participants choices and the backward AS effect was more
      dominant when forward AS was low. B, In the matching condition, there was a
      strong forward AS effect on participants choices, and the backward AS only had
      a positive effect when forward AS was low. C, In the solo condition, there was
      a strong forward AS effect on participants choices, and the modulation effect
      of the backward AS in this condition was weaker than that in the matching condition
      (by comparing the middle and right panels).3.2. fMRI resultsTable 1 lists all
      significant peak activations for the comparisons between Word LFHB and Word
      HFLB in each condition. For the signaling condition, we compared word LFHB with
      word HFLB and found activity in the bilateral mPFC, right ventral striatum,
      right TPJ, superior frontal gyrus (SFG), left precuneus, and left inferior frontal
      gyrus (IFG) (Fig. 4A). No significant activation was found for the reverse contrast.
      Our parametric analysis further showed that activity in the left ventral striatum
      in response to the Word LFHB was positively correlated with the differences
      between the forward and backward associative strengths during decision making
      (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the ventral striatum may encode the interference
      from the salience feature of forward association strength. In the matching condition,
      Word LFHB versus Word HFLB only activated the left ventral striatum (Fig. 4D).
      No significant activation was found for the reverse contrast. The parametric
      analysis showed that activity in the mPFC in response to the decision of choosing
      Word HFLB was significantly correlated with the differences between the forward
      and backward associative strengths (Fig. 5B). For the solo condition, no supra-threshold
      clusters were found for the contrast of Word LFHB versus Word HFLB or Word HFLB
      versus Word LFHB (Fig. 4E). The parametric analysis in the solo condition found
      increased activity in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) as the
      differences between the forward and backward associative strengths increased
      when choosing Word HFLB (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the interaction contrast between

      Brain activations of the parametric analysis. A, In the signaling condition,
      the left ventral striatum encoded the differences between forward AS and backward
      AS when choosing Word LFHB. B, In the matching condition, the mPFC encoded the
      differences between forward AS and backward AS when choosing Word HFLB. C, In
      the solo condition, the dmPFC encoded the differences between forward AS and
      backward AS when choosing Word HFLB.In addition, high order PPI analyses with
      the bilateral mPFC that activated in the signaling condition as seeds further
      showed that the coupling between mPFC and ventral striatum significantly predicted
      individual differences in communication success (i.e., choosing the Word LFHB
      minus choosing the Word HFLB) during decision-making in the signaling condition
      (Fig. 4C, left panel). The regions with significant activation in high order
      PPI analyses are listed in Table 2. In other words, participants who were more
      capable of switching their viewpoint from self to other in communication showed
      higher levels of coupling between the mPFC and ventral striatum (Fig. 4C, right
      panel). This coactivation between mPFC and ventral striatum was not found in
      the non-communicative conditions, i.e., matching and solo conditions.Table 2.

      FWE after small volume correction.4. DiscussionUsing a novel signaling task
      combined with fMRI, we examined the neural correlates of allocentric thinking
      during communication. We found that the mPFC, ventral striatum, and TPJ were
      more engaged when participants made allocentric choices in a communicative context.
      The interference from forward AS was associated with activity in the ventral
      striatum. Moreover, the neural coupling between mPFC and ventral striatum predicted
      individual differences in choosing the allocentric choices to promote communication
      success. These patterns were not found in the control conditions that do not
      require communicative signaling. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
      mPFC and striatum in allocentric thinking in social contexts, going beyond their
      putative role in coding the subjective value of reward and reward prediction
      error.In the signaling condition, signalers need to choose the most effective
      cue to help listeners get the message to be sent. It is crucial for the signaler
      to take the perspective of the person receiving the signal and consider the
      cue that is likely to be inferred correctly by the receiver. Our behavioral
      data showed that participants were more likely to choose LFHB words than HFLB
      words in the signaling condition but not in the other two conditions, suggesting
      that they do have the ability to think from receivers point of view if needed.
      In addition, the reaction times of making decisions were slower in the signaling
      condition compared with the other two conditions, suggesting that signaling
      to others is generally more taxing than non-communicative coordination with
      others. Our regression model further showed that participants were indeed guided,
      to some degree, by backward AS when making choices in the signaling condition.Success
      in communication relies on speakers choosing utterances that can be used by
      listeners to infer the intended information. Indeed, previous studies have shown
      that listeners spontaneously seek to incorporate information about the speaker''s
      mental state during communication. In a targeted language game in which participants
      had a joint goal requiring them to exchange information, eye-tracking data showed
      that addressees used the distinction between shared and private information
      as they interpreted language on-line (Brown-Schmidt et al., 2008; Heller et
      al., 2008). In interactive conversations, listeners represent information about
      the perspective of the speaker and use this information to guide the processing
      of the speaker''s utterances (Frank and Goodman, 2012; Franke and Degen, 2016).
      Taken together, these findings corroborate that successful communication is
      contingent on mutual strategic reasoning-from both the speaker sending relevant
      information, and the listener extracting it.Importantly, our study found enhanced
      activity in the mPFC, ventral striatum, and TPJ when participants chose LFHB
      words over HFLB words in the singling condition. The TPJ has been found in mentalizing
      tasks using hypothetical scenarios. It has been proposed that TPJ represents
      an epistemic or cognitive aspect of mentalization, whereas mPFC encodes the
      motivational component of ToM (Jenkins and Mitchell, 2010; Koster-Hale et al.,
      2017). The TPJ activity in our study may reflect individuals understanding of
      others knowledge. Both the mPFC and ventral striatum are implicated in both
      reward-based learning and social learning (Garrison et al., 2013). It has been
      suggested that the mPFC serves as a module that integrates social information
      and represents intentionality at a more abstract cognitive level (Sui and Gu,
      2017; Van Overwalle, 2009). Previous studies have shown that mPFC represents
      the similarity between self and others (Mobbs et al., 2015; Mobbs et al., 2009).
      Dumontheil et al. (2010a, 2010b) using the director task also found parts of
      the mentalizing network, including the mPFC and temporal pole, was activated
      when individuals followed the director''s instructions to move objects. A neuroimaging
      meta-analysis further confirmed that mPFC is closely linked to perspective-taking
      (D''Argembeau et al., 2007; Denny et al., 2012). The enhanced activity in mPFC
      when participants engage in allocentric thinking may indicate switching from
      self-centered to other-centered perspectives. Spatial and functional gradience
      for mentalizing has been shown in mPFC (Denny et al., 2012). It has been demonstrated
      that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is more associated with self-processing
      (Hu et al., 2016; Sui and Humphreys, 2015), while the dorsomedial prefrontal
      is more associated with other-related processing, such as mentalizing/theory
      of mind (Hu et al., 2016; Sul et al., 2015). Both ventral and dorsal mPFC were
      activated in response to allocentric thinking in our signaling condition. Our
      findings may suggest that taking other-oriented perspectives involves both the
      self-referential process and mentalizing processes. The functional segregation
      and integration of mPFC subregions in communicative contexts may be an interesting
      topic for future studies. The ventral striatum plays a crucial role in goal-directed
      learning (Guo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2020; O''Doherty et al., 2004) as
      well as reward processing (Yaple et al., 2020). It is important to note that
      activity in the ventral striatum was correlated with the degree of interference
      induced by the conflict between forward and backward associative strengths.
      Our findings may suggest that the ventral striatum encodes the conflict between
      allocentric and egocentric thinking and subsequently guides signaling behaviors.
      In addition, even without an exogenous reward in the current study, successfully
      detecting and solving such a viewpoint conflict to achieve the communicative
      goal might be itself the reward. Indeed, the Rational Speech Act theory considers
      communication as a goal-directed activity and the speaker derives the social
      utility of helping the listener to achieve communicative goals (Goodman and
      Frank, 2016). The ventral striatum may be engaged in detecting the need for
      such perspective-changing to enable goal achievement.Moreover, we found that
      the functional connectivity between mPFC and ventral striatum predicted individual
      differences in the degree of allocentric thinking, indexing by the difference
      between the percentage of participants choosing Word LFHB and choosing Word
      HFLB in the signaling condition. Across a wide range of psychological tasks,
      a meta-analytic coactivation analysis showed mPFC coactivation with subcortical
      regions, especially the ventral striatum (de la Vega et al., 2016). Altered
      ventral striatal-medial prefrontal cortex connectivity has been found in individuals
      with social problems (Fareri et al., 2017), stress-related psychopathology (Hanson
      et al., 2018), and depression (Admon and Pizzagalli, 2015), suggesting that
      the coupling between these two regions play a pivotal role in supporting smooth
      social interactions. The strength of functional connectivity between the striatum
      and mPFC has also been associated with learning speed in a probabilistic environment
      (van den Bos et al., 2012). Decreased frontostriatal functional connectivity
      was associated with reduced cognitive flexibility (Vaghi et al., 2017). Frontostriatal
      hyperconnectivity in high performing individuals in a signaling task might represent
      their ability to inhibit the innate tendency to choose self-related words and
      make goal-directed choices. Our study delineates how self-other viewpoint conflicts
      are encoded in the brain and provides some preliminary biological evidence for
      the inferential processing between self and other in pragmatic reasoning.Although
      not the focus of our study, we also found that the ventral striatum was activated
      when participants chose the low forward and high backward words in the matching
      task. Activity in the mPFC was correlated with the difference between forward
      AS and backward AS when choosing Word HFLB. These findings suggest that mPFC
      and striatum may also play an important role in pure coordination. Our previous
      study found that mPFC is engaged in perspective-taking when participants managed
      to reach focal points during pure coordination (Chowdhury et al., 2020). In
      the context of pure coordination in which participants were provided with symmetry
      information, individuals should be guided by forward AS alone and there is no
      obvious conflict arising from the differences between forward and backward AS.
      Thus, such coordination does not require the inhibition of automatic egocentric
      thinking driven by forward AS. Nevertheless, perspective-taking is needed for
      successful coordination even though one''s own perspective and others perspective
      may just be the same in most cases.In summary, although mentalizing has been
      linked to several brain regions, our study points out the key role of the mPFC-striatum
      network in supporting spontaneous allocentric thinking in successful communication.
      Our findings contribute to the deconstruction and specification of the mentalizing
      processes in social communication and shed light on how the brain implements
      viewpoint conflict resolution to achieve communicative signaling goals. Future
      studies may further examine whether modulating activity in this frontostriatal
      network could boost or hinder performance in communicative tasks.Data and code

      Introduction \n  \nWith more than 25% of high school seniors reporting recent
      use and 6.5% of 12th graders being daily users ( ), marijuana (MJ) is the most
      frequently used illicit substance among adolescents. Across all age groups over
      70% of new drug initiates start with using MJ at an average age of 18 years
      ( ). Indeed, the scope of MJ use prevalence is of great public interest, as
      MJ use in early adolescence is associated with increased risk of greater substance
      use, legal problems, disrupting education, injuries/medical problems, developing
      psychopathology, cognitive changes and chronic psychosocial struggles ( ,  ,  ,  ).
      Taken together, rates of MJ use are suggestive of an epidemic based in adolescence,
      which is concerning not just due to societal cost, but also due to the potential
      to offset sensitive brain development during this period. \n\nDespite its prevalence,
      the impact of MJ use on adolescent brain development is not fully known. Important
      neuromaturational processes during adolescence through young adulthood are believed
      to bring about improved higher-order cognition by refining neural systems locally
      and globally through white and gray matter development ( ,  ,  ). In general,
      gray matter reductions and cortical thinning coincide with increased white matter
      volume and organization through adolescence and young adulthood, suggestive
      of synaptic pruning and axonal myelination ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The endogenous cannabinoid
      (CB) system is also immature during adolescence ( ,  ). In an animal model (
      ) imaged CB1 receptor binding using PET and found relatively lower activation
      of CB1 receptors in adolescent rats compared to adult rats in brain areas including
      those in the frontal cortex, temporal lobe (hippocampus and amygdala) and sub-cortical
      regions including striatal regions, thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus.
      Thus, adolescence represents a developmental period with vulnerability to structural
      and functional changes due to exogenous MJ exposure. \n\nAdolescent MJ use has
      the potential to cause structural and functional changes in the brain by altering
      cannabinoid signaling. One possible mechanism would be blunt neurotoxic influence.
      For example, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component
      in MJ that binds CB1 receptors, is reported to cause cell shrinkage and damage
      DNA strands in THC-treated neuron cultures ( ). This may be the mechanism by
      which smaller volumes have been observed in individuals exposed to cannabis
      during adolescence ( ). However, it is more likely that MJ exerts its influence
      on brain development indirectly. The cannabinoid system plays a role in modulating
      other neurotransmitters, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate
      and monoamines ( ). Specifically, activation of CB1 receptors is associated
      with down-regulating inhibitory GABAergic transmission in cortical interneurons
      during adolescence ( ,  ). In addition, CB signaling inhibits microglia function
      ( ). These two points are important because cortical pruning processes involve
      glial-mediated synaptic elimination and altering the excitatory/inhibitory balance
      is liable to disrupt the selective tagging and preserving synapses ( ). The
      impact of this indirect influence on the developing brain may be in the observations
      of abnormal connectivity in those who began MJ use in adolescence ( ). Evidence
      from human neuroimaging studies lends greater support to MJ-related disruptions
      to brain development. \n\nStructural neuroimaging studies have indicated that
      volumes of several brain areas are smaller in heavy adult MJ users especially
      in areas enriched with cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors, such as medial temporal
      lobe, and prefrontal cortex ( ). Studies of adult chronic MJ users note brain
      volume reductions in temporal lobe, insula, and prefrontal cortex, amygdala
      and hippocampus ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Among different characteristics of MJ involvement
      (e.g., dependence symptoms, use frequency, consumption), the age of initial
      MJ use is a robust factor that has been associated with smaller brain volumes
      in users. For example,   observed left parahippocampal gyrus and right temporal
      pole structural differences in 25 regular MJ users compared to 22 occasional
      users, however, even the occasional users who began smoking MJ during adolescence
      (before age 18) demonstrated similar brain changes as the regular users. Our
      group has also found links with early MJ use onset ( ) and structural connectivity
      with orbitofrontal cortex in a cohort of daily MJ users, suggesting complex
      neuroadaptive processes related to MJ use in the context of adolescent brain
      development ( ). These findings underscore the potential for significant heterogeneity
      in brain changes among adult MJ users, especially those who began using MJ during
      neurodevelopment. \n\nStudies comparing early adolescent MJ use to users initiating
      MJ use in later adolescence provide further evidence for the potential of MJ
      to cause enduring change. The few studies that have directly investigated the
      timing of the effects of MJ during adolescence have noted divergent neurodevelopment
      effects. For example, in an fMRI study by Gruber and colleagues, functional
      and behavioral differences during an interference task were reported between
      early (before age 16) and late (after age 16) MJ users ( ) ( ). The same group
      also reported decreased white matter integrity in early onset vs. late onset
      MJ users (mean age 14.46 vs. 17.93) ( ). Similar differential effects have also
      been noted in parietal lobe activation between early and late adolescent binge
      drinkers during a spatial working memory task ( ). These studies highlight the
      importance of clarifying the differential neural effects of early- and late-adolescent
      onset use. \n\nTo that end, in the current study, we compared daily MJ users
      who were early onset users (<16 years old) versus late onset users (16 years
      old) on measures of cortical morphology that are sensitive to developmental
      changes. We aimed to characterize both the effect of early onset status on cortical
      morphology as well as assess for morphological patterns linked to the continued
      use of MJ after early and late adolescent MJ initiation. We expected early onset
      users to show a morphological pattern consistent with disruption of early adolescent
      brain development (e.g., increased cortical thickness, greater gray/white definition
      of the cortical ribbon via disruptions to adolescent pruning processes) that
      may be more consistent with indirect impact of MJ of brain development. While
      gray matter decline has been shown to be associated with marijuana use, particularly
      in areas rich in CB1 receptors, increased cortical thickness and greater gray/white
      definition in the cortical ribbon point to potential disruption in neurodevelopment
      (i.e. synaptic pruning) that may result from MJ use at key developmental stages
      (i.e. earlier as opposed to later in adolescent neuronal development). Such
      disruptions may extend to gyrification as well. While this process begins in
      utero, there is evidence that gyrification is ongoing into adolescence ( ,  ,  )
      and may also display aberrant developmental patterns in the presence of MJ use.
      \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis study was approved by the University of Texas at
      Dallas (UTD) and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) Institutional
      Review Boards. All participants were recruited from the Dallas-Ft.Worth metro
      area via flyers and advertisements. Following informed consent, MJ users completed
      two sessions  a baseline appointment for collecting demographic, psychosocial
      and behavioral measures and a thorough substance use history. Three days later
      the participants returned for a neuroimaging appointment. Prior to their scanning
      session, participants were asked to be abstinent from MJ use for 72h, from alcohol
      for 24h, and from caffeine and cigarettes for the preceding 2h. These were confirmed
      by self-report (MJ, alcohol, caffeine and cigarettes), quantitative THC urinalysis
      (MJ), and by breath alcohol level of .000 (alcohol) at the start of their session.
      \n\n### Participants \n  \nWe scanned 45 regular heavy MJ users as part of the
      parent project. Inclusion criteria were: right-handedness, English as the primary
      language and no histories of psychosis, traumatic brain injury, and MRI contraindications
      (e.g., pregnancy, non-removal metallic implants, claustrophobia). One subject
      reported a history of anxiety and depression and one other reported a history
      of ADHD as a child. Additional exclusions for the current study included: Axis
      I diagnosis (via SCID) other than cannabis use disorder, unusable sMRI due to
      motion artifact or poor signal-to-noise ratio that precluded accurate tissue
      segmentation (  n  =1) and incomplete drug use histories (  n  =2). Of the 42
      remaining cases, 22 were early onset users (onset of first use before age 16).
      Group categorization using onset of regular use as opposed to onset of first
      use maintained the same grouping (mean early onset of regular use=16.5, mean
      late onset of regular use=19.0). Regular use was defined as at least one time
      per week. To determine how age of onset of regular MJ use influenced our reported
      effects, we performed these analyses while covarying for age of onset of regular
      use (see  ).   summarizes demographic and substance use information according
      to onset status.   summarizes the correlation between age and identified marijuana
      use variables. Only MJ years of use and current age showed a statistically significant
      correlation. Participants were recruited based on self-reported daily MJ use
      and a positive urinalysis for THC metabolites at their baseline visit. All of
      the participants were screened via urinalysis for other drugs of abuse and were
      excluded if drugs (other than MJ) were detected. Participants were required
      to have used MJ for a minimum of 5000 lifetime occasions and self-report daily
      use (without >24h abstinence) for the last 60 days.   \nSample characteristics.

      acquisition \n  \nScanning sessions took place at the Advanced Imaging Research
      Center at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center three days following
      their initial visit. Another verification of THC metabolites via urinalysis
      was also performed before the scan. MRI images were collected using a 3T Philips
      whole-body scanner equipped with Quasar gradient subsystem (40mT/m amplitude,
      a slew rate of 220mT/m/ms). High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical scans were
      collected using a MPRAGE sequence: TR/TE/TI=2100/3.70/1100ms; flip angle=12;
      field of view=256mm256mm; slab thickness=160mm (along left-right direction);
      voxel size=1mm1mm1mm, Total scan time=3m 57s. \n\n\n#### Image processing \n  \nMPRAGE
      anatomical scans were pre-processed for surface-based analyses using FreeSurfer
      v5.3 semi-automated pipeline ( ). This semi-automated pipeline included spatial
      (Talairach) and signal intensity normalization of images, volumetric segmentation
      and subcortical labeling ( ,  ). Outer gray matter and white matter boundaries
      were then identified and reconstructed into a mesh of over 150,000 tessellated
      vertices to allow point-to-point surface measures ( ). Next, gyral anatomy is
      aligned to a standard spherical template using surface convexity and curvature
      measures. Resulting surfaces were inspected, blind to MJ onset status, to identify
      and correct any errors made during cortical reconstruction. Modifications to
      the volumes were made as necessary to correct for tissue misclassifications
      according to FreeSurfer''s wiki manual ( ). In preparation for analysis, each
      morphological measure for each case was co-registered to a standard template
      (fsaverage). Anatomical labels in FreeSurfer ( ) were used for interpretation
      of results. \n\n\n\n### Morphological measures \n  \n#### Cortical thickness
      \n  \nThe width of the cortical ribbon was measured as the distance between
      corresponding vertices of the white matter and gray matter surfaces at each
      vertex in the cortical mantel ( ). \n\n\n#### Graywhite matter ratio (GWR) \n  \nTo
      assess the quality of cortical ribbon definition, a tissue contrast between
      gray and white matter signal intensities was computed as a percent ratio (WG)/(.5*(W+G))
      (from pctsurfcon v1.11.2.1, inbuilt component of FreeSurfer pipeline v5.3, 2011).
      White matter signal intensities were measured at an absolute length of 1mm below
      the graywhite border surface and gray matter signal was measured 30% into the
      cortical ribbon ( ). \n\n\n#### Local gyrification index \n  \nThe cortical
      surface from FreeSurfer''s main pipeline is further processed to create an outer
      surface that encapsulates the gyral and sulcal curvature for each hemisphere,
      which serves as a basis for calculating a local gyrification index ( ). LGI
      is measured as the amount of cortex within the sulcal folds beneath the outer
      surface compared to the amount of visible cortex that touches the outer surface.
      Cortical maps are generated from repeated iterations of delineating a 25mm radius
      sphere on the outer surface and its corresponding point on the cortical surface
      using a matching algorithm. \n\n\n\n### Background and premorbid characteristics
      \n  \n#### Sample characteristics \n  \nAge, gender, education level, ethnicity,
      along with other background information, was obtained using a standard demographics
      questionnaire. The two-subtest administration of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale
      of Intelligence (Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning) provided estimates of intellect
      ( ). \n\n\n#### Substance use \n  \nThe Substance Use Disorder modules of the
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) ( ) were administered by a trained
      research assistant to assess for lifetime and current symptoms of abuse and
      dependence for alcohol, nicotine, MJ and other substances. The SCID interview
      also provided the onset of use information. A Time Line Follow-Back (TLFB) approach
      was used to quantify alcohol, nicotine, and MJ use patterns for 90 days prior
      to study participation ( ). Marijuana use in grams was obtained via self-report
      in response to probes aimed at quantifying their regular use. \n\n\n\n### Statistical
      analyses \n  \nStatistical analyses were conducted in SPSS 18.0 for behavioral
      and psychosocial measures whereas general linear model group comparisons on
      surfaced-based morphology measures were carried out FreeSurfer''s built-in application
      QDEC (v1.5). Independent samples   t  -tests, MannWhitney   U  -tests or chi-square
      tests, compared groups on background and demographic variables (see  ). Before
      statistical analysis was conducted, the dependent measures of cortical thickness,
      GWR and LGI were smoothed using a FWHM Gaussian filter with a width of either
      10 or 15mm. Separate univariate general linear model (GLM) was then used to
      model cortical thickness, GWR and LGI with onset status of MJ use as a between
      groups factor. The dependent variables were thickness, graywhite ratio or local
      gyrification index and the independent variables were either recent monthly
      MJ use in grams (MJ grams) or duration of MJ use (MJ years). Age and total drinks
      in the past 2 months were treated as nuisance covariates in the model. Using
      MJ years of use and MJ grams as independent predictors of interest allowed us
      to characterize and differentiate the latent developmental effects from cumulative
      and current effects of MJ use. The variable marijuana years of use was based
      on the participants response to the question For how many years have you been
      using marijuana regularly? Of note, an outlier in the early onset group was
      removed before the statistical comparisons were performed. \n\n\n\n## Results
      \n  \n### Cortical thickness \n  \nThere were no regions of group differences
      in cortical thickness by early onset status alone, controlled for age and alcohol
      use. However, MJ use characteristics were correlated with anterior dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex thickness based on onset status. Early onset users showed
      increased thickness with increased MJ grams while late onset users showed thinner
      cortex with increased MJ grams (  p  <0.05 uncorrected) ( ). The same pattern
      emerged with more years of MJ use being associated with thicker region of the
      right medial temporal lobe in the early onset users and the reverse for the
      late onset users (  p  <0.05 uncorrected) ( ).   \nClusters of significant age

      matter contrast by early onset status alone, controlled for age and alcohol
      use. However, current MJ consumption (grams) and onset status were differentially
      correlated with graywhite matter contrast in a left anterior dorsal frontal
      region (  p  <0.05, FWE corrected). Increased graywhite contrast with heavier
      MJ use was seen in the early onset users and the opposite was seen in later
      onset users (heavier current use linked to decreasing GWR). The same pattern
      was seen between duration of MJ use in two prefrontal cortex clusters of the
      right dorsal frontal and medial orbitofrontal area   p  <0.05, FWE corrected  more
      years of MJ use were linked to greater GWR among early users ( ). \n\n\n###
      Gyrification \n  \nMJ use onset status alone showed no significant main effects
      above age and alcohol covariates. However, onset status was correlated with
      divergent patterns between local gyrification and MJ use, whereby early onset
      users showed decreasing LGI with increasing MJ consumption and longer duration
      of use in prefrontal cortex regions   p  <0.05, FWE corrected. The left hemisphere
      clusters encompassed the majority of the length of the middle lateral surface
      of the left cortex, including motor cortices, parietal lobe and multimodal integration
      areas ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study was designed to characterize
      the cortical architecture in adolescent onset MJ users by comparing early adolescent
      onset users to late adolescent onset in MJ use on measures of cortical thickness,
      gray/white matter contrast and gyrification. The primary finding was that early
      versus late onset MJ users showed a divergent pattern in cortical thickness,
      definition of the cortical ribbon and local gyrification with continued use
      through and beyond adolescent years. Specifically, early onset users showed
      cortical thickening, enhanced gray/white matter contrast, and decreased gyrification
      in association with more years of MJ use and current consumption of MJ in grams
      in frontal and temporal regions  areas that underlie higher order cognition
      including executive functioning, learning and memory. Findings were above and
      beyond effects of alcohol and current age, therefore, results are less likely
      to reflect morphological trends due to aging. \n\nOur findings did not find
      the expected age of onset differences previously reported in marijuana users
      ( ,  ). This inconsistency suggests that the age of onset effects may be more
      robust in brain white matter connectivity ( ) and function ( ) than brain surface
      morphometry. To date, the few studies that have described altered cortical morphology
      in MJ users have led to mixed findings.   identified brain regions with decreased
      sulcal depth suggestive of lower gyrification in a study of adult MJ users.   recently
      reported increased cortical thickness in the entorhinal cortex among 24 adolescent
      MJ users (mean age=17.7, mean MJ onset age=15.4) relative to peer controls.
      However, the authors also reported a negative relationship between cortical
      thickness and total MJ use in the right paracentral gyrus, and they observed
      consistent positive relationships in various brain regions between age of MJ
      onset and thickness. In the only other known adolescent study of cortical thickness
      and MJ, Lopez-Larson and colleagues studied 18 adolescent heavy MJ users (similar
      in age and MJ onset as  ) and reported mixed findings of increased thickness
      in prefrontal/insula regions and decreased thickness in posterior/temporal lobe
      areas in the MJ users compared to controls. In contrast to  ,   found areas
      of the frontal lobe and insula that were thinner with increased urine THC metabolites
      and thicker with earlier age of onset. Select findings from the current study
      align with aspects of both of these studies, with a consensus supporting findings
      of a negative dose-dependent relationship between MJ use and cortical thickness.
      Given the low availability of studies to compare, this consensus is very limited.
      Although Jacobus et al. and Lopez-Larson et al. found the opposite effect of
      age of onset on thickness, the pattern of divergence among early vs. late onset
      users in the current study is more consistent with the latter study, whereby
      we saw early onset users exhibit thicker cortex with continued MJ use. Taken
      together, findings of increased thickness related to early MJ onset accompanied
      by negative dose-dependent relationships with MJ exposure may reflect two distinct
      processes. One process may be specific to the interactions with cortical development
      during early adolescence, likely leading to a disruption in pruning, and, the
      other, specific to the pharmacological effect with heavy chronic MJ use. \n\nIn
      the only known study to examine the curvature-morphology of the cortex in adult
      MJ users,   identified decreased sulcal concavity and thinner sulci in 23MJ
      users compared to controls (  n  =44), also in prefrontal areas. However, they
      did not observe significant relationships with age, MJ onset age, or cumulative
      MJ use. It is interesting that the authors detected group level differences
      (MJ vs. controls) but no correlations with MJ use characteristics such as dose
      or age of onset, whereas our primary findings are the consistent effects of
      continued MJ use differing after early or late adolescent onset. There are substantial
      methodological explanations for this disparity. For example, the current study
      did not compare morphology in MJ users to a normative control sample, therefore,
      it is feasible that group-level differences may emerge with such a comparison.
      Likewise, we deliberately covaried for current age in order to control for brain
      changes with aging and thus optimize our interrogation of developmental effects
      of early onset age and of aspects of continued use. \n\nThe heterogeneity of
      MJ effects clearly suggests a multifactorial system of neurobiological processes
      involved. The primary results uphold that age of onset is a robust variable
      that differentiates heavy MJ users based on early versus late MJ onset. However,
      this group distinction relied on current use characteristics. Therefore, in
      the absence of group-level differences, the interactions between onset age and
      current use indicates that continued cannabis exposure and early adolescent
      developmental factors both contribute to a dynamic and sustained departure from
      what is expected based on developmental studies. \n\nTypical synaptic refinement
      processes during early adolescence are in the context of long-term depression
      and potentiation of cortical neurons in order to facilitate neuronal remodeling.
      Thus, the normal course of early adolescent development is uniquely vulnerable
      to disruption by MJ due to the electrochemical conditions and maturity of brain
      processes that would not present together again. Cass and colleagues tested
      the sensitivity of early adolescence cannabinoid exposure in an animal model
      ( ). They found that acute administration of cannabinoid agonists in early,
      middle and late adolescent rats led to a state of frequency-dependent disinhibition
      of neurons in the frontal cortex in the early-to-middle adolescent rats, but
      not in the late adolescent rats. Moreover, the authors also noted that adult
      rats previously exposed to cannabinoid agonists in adolescence displayed comparable
      neuronal disinhibition. Thus, by changing the inhibitory/excitatory landscape
      during adolescence, MJ can influence lasting changes to typical cortical remodeling
      during sensitive early adolescent years. \n\nThe sequence of pruning and myelination
      likely plays a formative role in lasting changes from early adolescent onset
      MJ use. With decreased synaptic elimination, our findings of greater GW border
      contrast may reflect greater proliferation of myelin at the boundary of the
      cortical ribbon where non-pruned synapses remained with linked axons. Findings
      of altered white matter tissue qualities are mixed in adolescent and adult MJ
      user samples. Some report both increases and decreases in fractional anisotropy
      (FA) and average water diffusion ( ) whereas others report consistent decreases
      in FA among adolescent MJ users ( ,  ) or null findings ( ). Two studies of
      diffusion tensor imaging in adult MJ users reported reduced FA in users compared
      to controls ( ,  ). In addition to equivocal findings, research is needed to
      address the microstructural changes that could result in altered definition
      of the cortical ribbon. For example, rather than whole brain techniques that
      assess diffusion measures along major white matter tracts, indices assessing
      axonal organization along radial and interneuron association fibers along the
      cortical ribbon are needed. This scenario played out could result in increased
      gray matter (thicker cortex from disrupted pruning) and the myelination of connections
      to these spared terminals would result in increased density of white matter
      at the cortical boundary. Without any known studies of adolescent development
      of the gray/white tissue contrast at the cortical border to serve as a point
      of comparison, we speculate that early adolescent disruption of pruning and
      subsequent myelination of connections at the cortical boundary would be reflected
      by increased GWR as we saw in the current study. \n\n\n## Limitations and conclusions
      \n  \nThe cross-sectional nature of this study limits causal attributions in
      terms of what we can infer to be directly related to the effects of MJ. Although
      a longitudinal design is optimal for addressing brain changes directly due to
      MJ, cross-sectional studies facilitate data-driven hypotheses that can be assessed
      directly in prospective studies. \n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the
      participants were not explicitly asked for possible years of abstinence during
      their period of regular use, which may have created possible inflation in reported
      duration of regular use. However, because the participants provided number of
      years of regular marijuana use, this inherently suggests continued, uninterrupted
      years of use. Concurrent nicotine use could have also influenced our reported
      results. But in the absence of a larger sample size and the presence of huge
      variance in nicotine use in the current sample, we were unable to verify the
      effect of nicotine use in the reported results. \n\nInterpretation of these
      findings is also limited by the lack of behavioral anchors for the observed
      morphological effects and lack of information on other aspects of developmental
      history that could further characterize the effects of marijuana during neurodevelopment.
      This is further limited by the absence of expected patterns based on normative
      data. Given the varied directions of effects and the small sample size, these
      findings should be replicated and be viewed as preliminary. \n\nTo conclude,
      early MJ use was linked to altered neurodevelopmental patterns in brain regions
      sub-serving higher-order cognitive process. Clinical implications include need
      for early, targeted intervention. Given that the most robust results were related
      to interactions between onset age and continued use through emerging adulthood,
      harm reduction approaches may be effective in moderating adolescent MJ use to
      levels that are less likely to cause long-term developmental changes. \n\n\n##

      the meaning of abstract mathematical symbols is a cornerstone of arithmetic
      learning in children. Studies have long focused on the role of spatial intuitions
      in the processing of numerals. However, it has been argued that such intuitions
      may also underlie symbols that convey fundamental arithmetic concepts, such
      as arithmetic operators. In the present cross-sectional study, we used fMRI
      to investigate how and when associations between arithmetic operators and brain
      regions processing spatial information emerge in children from 3rd to 10th grade.
      We found that the mere perception of a + sign elicited grade-related increases
      of spatial activity in the right hippocampus. That is, merely perceiving + signs  without
      any operands  elicited enhanced hippocampal activity after around 7th grade
      (1213 years old). In these children, hippocampal activity in response to a +
      sign was further correlated with the degree to which calculation performance
      was facilitated by the preview of that sign before an addition problem, an effect
      termed operator-priming. Grade-related increases of hippocampal spatial activity
      were operation-specific because they were not observed with  signs, which might
      evoke rote retrieval rather than numerical manipulation. Our study raises the
      possibility that hippocampal spatial mechanisms help build associations between
      some arithmetic operators and space throughout age and/or education.Keywords:
      Arithmetic, Development, Attention, Space, fMRI, Hippocampus1.IntroductionHumans
      are unique in their ability to represent abstract mathematical concepts by culturally
      invented symbols, such as Arabic numerals and arithmetic signs. Because these
      symbols are arbitrary, learning the relationship between their identity and
      the concept they represent is a challenge during early math education in children.
      Most prior studies have focused on the mechanisms supporting the acquisition
      of symbols representing numerical quantities (Piazza et al., 2007, Ansari, 2008,
      Holloway and Ansari, 2009, Lyons and Ansari, 2009, Mundy and Gilmore, 2009).
      However, efficient processing of symbols that convey fundamental arithmetic
      concepts (i.e., operators) may be an important and largely neglected aspect
      of arithmetic skills. This is suggested by the operator-priming effect (Roussel
      et al., 2002, Fayol and Thevenot, 2012, Mathieu et al., 2017), whereby the anticipated
      presentation of a + or - sign 150ms before a single-digit addition or subtraction
      problem facilitates problem-solving in adults.What aspect of the processing
      of an operator may cause the operator-priming effect in adults? A first possibility
      is that an arithmetic sign may automatically evoke a network of facts. For example,
      the perception of a + or - sign might pre-activate a network of additive or
      subtractive facts that would have been built in declarative memory after years
      of practice (Campbell and Xue, 2001, Ashcraft, 1992). Pre-activating such a
      network would facilitate the retrieval of the answer from memory when operands
      are presented. A second possibility is that an arithmetic sign may prime a specific
      procedure that would have been automatized after its repeated practice during
      arithmetic learning. For instance, Fayol and Thevenot argued that perceiving
      a + or - sign might trigger an automatized procedure that could be linked to
      the convocation of the mental number line and could correspond to a preparation
      for a quick left-to-right or right-to-left browsing of this mental line (Fayol
      and Thevenot, 2012). This proposal echoes the idea that adding or subtracting
      numbers involves rightward and leftward shifts of attention from a source to
      a target number along a mental map of numbers oriented from left to right, i.e.,
      the mental number line (MNL) (Hubbard et al., 2005, Masson and Pesenti, 2014,
      Mathieu et al., 2016, Pinheiro-Chagas et al., 2017). Pre-activating such a procedure
      would result in a facilitation of subsequent calculation when operands are presented,
      thereby explaining the operator-priming effect.Interestingly, two lines of evidence
      favor the procedural over the declarative interpretation of the operator-priming
      effect. First, the effect is not observed with the  sign and multiplication
      problems (Roussel et al., 2002, Mathieu et al., 2017). Multiplication problems,
      however, are explicitly learned by rote in school and multiplication is unanimously
      viewed as the operation having the strongest association with a network of facts
      in memory (Campbell and Xue, 2001, Galfano et al., 2003, Thibodeau et al., 1996).
      Therefore, the lack of operator-priming effect for multiplication problems is
      difficult to reconcile with the idea that the effect is due to associations
      between operators and networks of stored facts. Second, in line with Fayol and
      Thevenots proposal that + and  signs may prime a spatial scanning of the MNL,
      a recent study suggests that + and  signs do evoke spatial intuitions. Specifically,
      Pinhas et al. (2014) found that, when instructed to categorize + and  signs
      with left-hand or right-hand responses, adults tend to respond faster to + signs
      with the right hand than with the left hand, whereas they tend to respond faster
      to - signs with the left hand than with the right hand (Pinhas et al., 2014).
      Thus, + and  signs appear to have some automatic associations with the right
      and left sides of space, respectively.Using fMRI, we recently found that such
      spatial associations may stem from the fact that some arithmetic operators are
      automatically processed in brain regions involved in spatial attention in adults.
      We showed that the mere perception of a + sign elicits greater activity than
      the mere perception of a  sign in brain regions underlying overt spatial attention.
      These included the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the posterior superior parietal
      lobule (PSPL) (Mathieu et al., 2017). Thus, perceiving a + sign (but not a  sign)
      may be associated with a deployment of spatial attention in educated adults.
      Therefore, the rightward shifts of attention that have been posited to underlie
      addition problem-solving (Hubbard et al., 2005, Masson and Pesenti, 2014, Mathieu
      et al., 2016) might be primed by the mere preview of the addition sign (but
      not by the preview of a multiplication sign because multiplication is typically
      learned by rote and unlikely to be associated with movements along the MNL).
      Overall, there is mounting evidence that at least some arithmetic operators
      (e.g., + but not  signs) evoke spatial intuitions in adults, and that these
      intuitions may relate to the operator-priming effect.However, associations between
      operators and space are arguably not innate. Therefore, a fundamental outstanding
      question is how and when such associations emerge in the developing brain. To
      answer that question, we studied 34 children from 3rd to 10th grade while they
      performed 3 tasks. First, fMRI activity was measured while children were instructed
      to make eye saccades towards visually presented targets. This allowed us to
      precisely localize several regions of interest (ROIs) involved in spatial attention
      across children. Second, fMRI activity was measured in these spatial attention
      ROIs while children were presented with trials in which a + sign was displayed
      without any operands (hereafter addition sign-only trials). As in our previous
      study in adults (Mathieu et al., accepted), activity during the perception of
      addition sign-only trials was compared to activity associated with trials in
      which a  sign was displayed without any operands (hereafter multiplication sign-only
      trials) because these do not appear to evoke any specific intuitions in adults
      (Fayol and Thevenot 2012). This allowed us to identify the spatial attention
      ROIs in which activity in response to a + sign (as compared to a  sign) increases
      with age and/or education, as well as the developmental time course of these
      effects.1 Third, outside of the scanner, we asked subjects to perform an operator-priming
      task and measured the correlation between inter-individual differences in the
      size of the operator-priming effect and inter-individual differences in sign-related
      activity in spatial attention ROIs as a function of grade. This allowed us to
      evaluate when sign-related activity in spatial attention ROIs leads to an operator-priming
      effect in children.2.Material and methods2.1. ParticipantsForty-two right-handed
      children from 3rd to 10th grade participated in the study. All were native French
      speakers. Participants did not have prior history of neurological disease, psychiatric
      disorders, learning disabilities or attention deficits. All children and parents
      provided written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved
      by the local ethics committee (CPP Sud-Est-II). Families received 80 for their
      participation. Data from 8 subjects were excluded because of excessive head-movement
      in the scanner (see criteria in the Section 2.7., n=3), poor whole-brain coverage
      (i.e. susceptibility artefacts from dental braces, n=3) and unacceptably low
      performance during the task (i.e., lower than 50% accuracy on the sign-plus-operand
      trials, n=2). Therefore, the final sample consisted of 34 children (20 males)
      from 3rd to 10th grade (age range: 815, mean age=11.37, SD=1.84). For each child,
      a continuous measure of grade was calculated by taking into account the specific
      date within the grade year when that child was scanned. The whole sample (n=34)
      was evenly split into three groups as a function of grade: 11 children were
      from the lower grades group (grade 3.25.4; mean=4.4), 11 children were from
      the intermediate grades group (grade 5.66.9; mean=6.2), and 12 children were
      from the higher grades group (grade 7.610.2; mean=8.5).2.2. Standardized measuresChildren
      were administered standardized tests of intellectual and arithmetic abilities
      to ensure that there were no age differences with respect to those measures.
      Full-scale IQ was measured using the NEMI-2 (Cognet, 2006). Basic arithmetic
      knowledge was evaluated with the Math-Fluency subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson-III
      Tests of Achievement (WJ-III) (Woodcock et al., 2001). Across all participants,
      standardized (i.e., age-normalized) scores on IQ (mean=112; SD=10) and Math
      Fluency (mean=106; SD=16) tests were within the normal range. One-way ANOVAs
      with the between-subject factor group (lower, intermediate, higher grades) revealed
      no main effect of group on IQ (F(2,31)=0.591, p=0.560, BF10=0.29), indicating
      that age-normalized intellectual abilities were similar across groups. However,
      there was a main effect of group on Math Fluency (F(2,31)=5.867, p=0.007, BF10=7.24):
      Children from intermediate grades had a higher age-normalized score (mean=118;
      SD=18) than children from lower (mean=100; SD=11) and higher grades (mean=100;
      SD=13). Therefore, we included standardized Math-Fluency scores as nuisance
      covariate in all of our analyses.2.3. Behavioral sessionAfter standardized testing,
      children participated in a behavioral session during which they performed an
      operator-priming task adapted from Fayol and Thevenot (2012) and Roussel et
      al. (2002). Children were asked to evaluate 56 single-digit addition and 56
      multiplication problems composed of operands between 2 and 9. Problems were
      presented in both commutative orders. Tie problems were excluded. Problems with
      a sum smaller than or equal to 11 and a product smaller or equal to 24 were
      considered small. Other problems were considered large.In each trial, a problem
      was presented with an answer (Fig. 1a). The arithmetic sign was presented either
      150ms before (Negative SOA condition) or at the same time (Null SOA condition)
      as the operands (Fig. 1a). All problems were presented once in both SOA condition
      with a valid answer. Twenty-eight addition and 28 multiplication problems were
      also presented in both SOA condition with an invalid answer (obtained by adding
      or subtracting 1 to or from the valid answer). Trials were pseudorandomly ordered
      so that no more than three problems of the same type appeared consecutively.
      Problems with an invalid answer were randomly chosen across subjects and the
      order of blocks was counter-balanced between subjects. The experiment started
      with 8 practice trials.Open in a separate windowFig. 1Experimental design. (a)
      During the behavioral session, children (n=34) were asked to evaluate the result
      of single-digit addition and multiplication problems. For both operations, the
      arithmetic sign was presented either 150ms before (negative SOA trials), or
      at the same time as the operands (null SOA trials). (b) In the scanner, children
      (n=34) performed an arithmetic task during which they were presented with sign-only
      (left) and sign-plus-operands (right) addition, multiplication and baseline
      trials. In each trial, a sign (+,  or ) was presented at the center of the screen
      for 150ms. In sign-only trials, the trial ended with the presentation of the
      sign and was simply followed by the inter-trial period of fixation. In sign-plus-operands
      trials (filler trials), the + or  sign was immediately followed by a single-digit
      addition or multiplication problem (respectively) presented along an answer
      and the  sign was followed by 3 letters. In those cases, children had 5000ms
      to evaluate whether the answer of the problem was true or false or to indicate
      whether one of the 3 letters was a B.The experiment was controlled by Presentation
      software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA). Problems were displayed in white
      Arial 60-point font on a black background. All trials started with the presentation
      of a white central fixation dot for 1500ms, immediately followed by a red central
      fixation dot for 1000ms signaling that the problem was about to be presented,
      either in the negative SOA condition or in the null SOA condition (Fig. 1a).
      Subjects had a maximum of 5000ms to evaluate whether the response was valid
      or invalid as quickly as possible by pressing one of two keys on the computer
      keyboard.2.4. fMRI sessionDuring fMRI scanning, children performed a spatial
      attention localizer task and an arithmetic task. The spatial attention localizer
      task consisted in alternating blocks of fixation and saccades. During saccade
      blocks (n=9), participants were asked to make saccades towards several successive
      target dots. Each saccade block contained 16 target dots (0.2 visual angle)
      that appeared at random positions with an eccentricity of 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5
      or 5.5 in the left or right visual field for an average of 800ms (with a jitter
      of 200ms). During fixation blocks (n=9), participants were asked to maintain
      fixation on a central dot for 12,800ms. Block order was counterbalanced across
      children.During the arithmetic task, children were presented with sign-only
      and sign-plus-operands versions of addition and multiplication trials (Fig.
      1b). Each trial started with the presentation of either a + or a  sign at the
      center of the screen for 150ms. In sign-only trials (n=30), the trial ended
      with the presentation of the sign and was simply followed by the inter-trial
      period of fixation (see below). These sign-only trials were our trials of interest
      and allowed us to isolate neural activity due to the presentation of a sign
      alone. We also included in the experiment sign-plus-operands trials (n=50).
      In those filler trials, the + or  sign was immediately followed by a single-digit
      addition or multiplication problem (respectively) presented with an answer.
      Participants were asked to indicate whether the answer was true or false. The
      goal of these filler trials (for which associated activity would be difficult
      to interpret because any effects could be attributable to the anticipatory presentation
      of the operator, the appearance of the operands, or a combination of both of
      these factors) was only to keep children engaged and attentive in the scanner.
      They also induced an arithmetic context, thereby ensuring that the + and  signs
      presented in sign-only trials were perceived as arithmetic signs. Problems in
      sign-plus-operand trials were constructed following the same criteria as in
      the behavioral session. Finally, the baseline consisted in trials in which the
      arithmetic sign was replaced by an abstract non-arithmetic sign (i.e., ). We
      included 30 baseline sign-only trials (in which the  sign was presented in isolation)
      and 50 baseline sign-plus-operand trials (in which the  sign was followed by
      3 letters and participants had to indicate whether one of these letters was
      a B). All trials were followed by a variable period of visual fixation ranging
      from 3000ms to 3800ms. That period consisted in a central white fixation dot
      that turned red 1000ms before the onset of the next trial. The arithmetic task
      was decomposed in 4 functional runs. All trials were intermixed and the timing
      and order of trial presentation within each run was optimized for estimation
      efficiency using optseq2 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/optseq/). Behavioral
      responses were recorded using an MR-compatible response device.Stimuli were
      generated using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA).
      Prior scanning, children were familiarized with the fMRI environment during
      a practice session that took place after the standardized testing and the behavioral
      session. During this practice session, children learned to minimize head movement
      in a mock fMRI scanner. The actual scanning session took place no more than
      3 weeks after the practice session.2.5. Behavioral analysesRT data associated
      with the operator-priming task were normalized using a logarithmic transformation
      prior all analyses to improve the conformity of the data to the standard assumptions
      of parametric testing. Following Fayol and Thevenot (2012), mean RT was analyzed
      using planned comparisons that followed from a within-subject ANOVA with the
      factors Operation (Addition/Multiplication) and SOA (Negative/Null), conducted
      separately for each group. We report for all effects the corresponding Bayes
      factors (BF10), indicating the strength of evidence for the alternative hypothesis
      (H1) relative to the null hypothesis (H0). Substantial evidence in favor of
      the alternative hypothesis is typically suggested by a BF10 greater than 3 (Jeffreys,
      1961, Dienes, 2011).2.6. fMRI data acquisitionImages were collected with a Siemens
      Prisma 3T MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) at the CERMEP
      Imagerie du vivant in Lyon, France. The BOLD signal was measured with a susceptibility
      weighted single-shot EPI sequence. Imaging parameters were as follows: TR=2000ms,
      TE=24ms, flip angle=80, matrix size=128120, field of view=220206mm, slice thickness=3mm
      (0.48mm gap), number of slices=32. A high-resolution T1-weighted whole-brain
      anatomical volume was also collected for each participant. Parameters were as
      follows: TR=3500ms, TE=2.24ms, flip angle=8, matrix size=256256, field of view=224224mm,
      slice thickness=0.9mm, number of slices=192.2.7. fMRI preprocessingData analysis
      was performed using SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Functional images
      were corrected for slice acquisition delays and spatially realigned to the first
      image of the first run. Images were then spatially smoothed with a Gaussian
      filter equal to twice the voxel size. ArtRepair was used to help remove motion
      from the functional images prior to normalization (Mazaika et al., 2009). Volumes
      with rapid scan-to-scan movements of greater than 1.5mm were repaired by interpolation
      of the two nearest non-repaired scans. Each run with more than 5% of the total
      number of volumes replaced was removed from the analyses. A subject was excluded
      from further analysis if more than one run was removed. The number of volumes
      replaced did not differ between grade groups (F(2,31)=2.20; p=0.13). Finally,
      functional images were normalized into the standard MNI space (normalized voxel
      size, 223.5mm3).2.8. fMRI processingEvent-related statistical analysis was performed
      according to the general linear model (GLM). For the localizer task, brain activity
      associated with saccades and fixation blocks was modeled as epochs with onsets
      and offsets time-locked to the beginning and the end of each block. Each epoch
      was convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the time
      series data from each run were high-pass filtered (1/128Hz). Finally, serial
      correlations were corrected using an autoregressive AR(1) model. Following our
      previous study using the same task in adults (Mathieu et al., 2017), brain activity
      associated with sign-only trials during the arithmetic task was estimated using
      a finite impulse response (FIR) model. We modeled 8 time points with an interval
      of 2s (corresponding to one TR) ranging from the onset of the sign to 16s after
      the sign. The magnitude of the fMRI response for each type of sign-only trial
      was calculated by subtracting activity at the onset of the sign (i.e., 1st bin,
      or 0s after the onset) from the peak activity (i.e., 4th bin, or 8s after the
      onset). The time series data from each run were high-pass filtered (1/128Hz),
      and serial correlations were corrected using an autoregressive AR(1) model.2.9.
      Region of interest (ROI) definition and analysesThe present study used a Region-of-Interest
      (ROI) approach to analyze brain activity associated with sign-only trials in
      brain regions involved in the orienting of spatial attention in children. All
      ROIs were independently defined using the contrast of saccades versus fixation
      blocks in the spatial attention localizer task. All subject-specific contrasts
      were entered into a random effect (RFX) one-sample t-test across subjects. The
      RFX contrast map was then thresholded across the whole-brain using an uncorrected
      voxel-level threshold of p<0.001 and a false-discovery-rate (FDR) corrected
      cluster-level threshold of p<0.05 (Chumbley and Friston 2009). Using the SPM
      toolbox Marsbar (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/), ROIs were defined as 6-mm
      radius spheres around the peak coordinate of each region.Within each ROI and
      for each participant, we calculated the average response (parameter estimates)
      for + signs using the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline
      sign-only trials. Similarly, we calculated the average response for  signs using
      the contrast of multiplication sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials.
      Two analyses were performed in each ROI. First, we identified the ROI(s) in
      which a difference in fMRI activity between + and  signs emerged throughout
      age and/or education, using a 32 ANOVA with the between-subject factor group
      (lower/intermediate/higher grades) and the within-subject factor sign (+/).
      Second, we tested in these ROIs whether inter-individual differences in the
      fMRI response to an arithmetic sign were correlated with inter-individual differences
      in the size of the operator-priming effect (measured in the behavioral session)
      for each group. In all analyses, we report uncorrected P values as well as P
      values corrected for multiple comparisons across all identified ROIs using the
      Bonferroni procedure. Bayes factor are also reported.3.Results3.1. The spatial
      localizer task activates a brain network encompassing frontal, parietal, occipital
      and hippocampal regionsContrasting saccades to fixation blocks in the spatial
      attention localizer task, we first identified 10 clusters supporting the orienting
      of spatial attention across subjects: the bilateral Frontal Eye Field (FEF),
      bilateral Posterior Superior Parietal Lobule (PSPL), bilateral Middle Temporal
      Gyri (MTG), bilateral Middle Occipital Gyri (MOG), right dorsal Inferior Frontal
      Gyrus (dIFG), and right Hippocampus (see Table 1 and Fig. 2). Therefore, a large
      brain network was involved in the orienting of spatial attention across subjects.
      Each of these regions served as an ROI in subsequent analyses.Table 1Brain regions

      region identified by the spatial localizer task is increasingly activated in
      response to a + sign but not to a  sign throughout age and/or educationA 32
      ANOVA with the between-subject factor group (lower/intermediate/higher grades)
      and the within-subject factor sign (+/) was then conducted in each of the 10
      ROIs identified by the spatial attention localizer. We found an interaction
      between group and sign in the right hippocampus (F(2.30)=6.75, p=0.0038, pcorr=0.038;
      Fig. 3a and b), but not in any other ROIs (all Fs<3.44, all ps>0.046, all pscorr>0.46).
      Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for this interaction in
      the right hippocampus (BF10=11.53), while no or anecdotal evidence for such
      an interaction was found in the other ROIs (BF10<1.63). Follow-up t-tests in
      the hippocampus ROI revealed that children from higher grades (average grade=8.5)
      exhibited greater activity for addition than multiplication sign-only trials
      (t11=3.02, p=0.012), whereas there was no difference between signs in children
      from intermediate grades (average grade=6.2) (t10=0.87, p=0.41) and even a trend
      for less activity for addition than multiplication sign-only trials in children
      from lower grades (average grade=4.4) (t10=2.22, p=0.051). Bayes Factor analysis
      indicated substantial evidence for a difference of activity between addition
      and multiplication sign-only trials in children from higher grades (BF10=5.21),
      but evidence for this difference was absent in intermediate grades (BF10=0.41)
      and anecdotal in lower grades (BF10=1.69). Finally, across all groups, addition
      sign-only trials were associated with greater activity than baseline sign-only
      trials in children from higher grades (t11=2.63, p=0.023), but not in any other
      groups (all ts<1.32, all ps>0.21). Multiplication sign-only trials were associated
      with greater activity than baseline sign-only trials in none of the groups (all
      ts<1.38, all ps>0.20). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence
      for a difference between addition sign-only trials and baseline sign-only trials
      in children from higher grades (BF10=3.00), but no or anecdotal evidence in
      the other groups (all BF10s<0.60) and for multiplication sign-only trials (all
      BF10s<0.63). Overall, then, a difference in fMRI response to a + and a  sign
      emerged throughout age and/or education in the right hippocampus.Open in a separate
      windowFig. 3Grade-related changes of activity in the right hippocampus.(a) Location

      age=9.4), intermediate (n=11; grade 5.66.9; mean grade=6.2; mean age=11.1) and
      higher grades (n=12; grade 7.610.2; mean grade=8.5; mean age=13.4). (c) Difference
      in activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials over grade
      in the right Hippocampus. *p<0.05; r represents the Pearson correlation coefficient.The
      findings above were confirmed by an additional correlation analysis in which
      grade was treated as a continuous predictor across all subjects. The difference
      in activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials was positively
      correlated with grade in the right hippocampus (r=0.53, p=0.001, pcorr=0.01;
      Fig. 3c). No other significant grade-related changes were found in any other
      regions (all rs<0.38, all ps>0.03, all pscorr>0.30). Bayes Factor analysis indicated
      substantial evidence for this correlation in the right hippocampus (BF10=20.97),
      but no or anecdotal evidence in any other ROIs (all BF10s<2.03). In the right
      hippocampus, the correlation between grade and the contrast of addition sign-only
      trials versus baseline sign-only trials, was also near significance (r=0.33,
      p=0.056; BF10=1.22).2 The correlation between grade and the contrast of multiplication
      sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials, however, was not significant
      (r=0.18, p=0.32; BF10=0.35).3.3. Spatial hippocampal activity in response to
      a + sign relates to an addition-priming effect in children from higher gradesWe
      then tested whether the hippocampal response to a + sign observed in children
      from higher grades was related to the operator-priming effect. To this aim,
      each child performed a version of the operator-priming task outside of the scanner
      (see Fig. 1a).First, we tested whether the results obtained by Fayol and Thevenot
      (2012) in adults (i.e., an operator-priming effect for addition but not for
      multiplication across subjects) could be extended to our children participants.
      Because children from lower grades had a performance close to chance on large
      problems (58%), we exclusively focused our analyses on small problems for which
      accuracy was significantly above chance in all groups (lower grades: 80%, intermediate
      grades: 92%, higher grades: 96%). Planned comparisons revealed an operator-priming
      effect for addition in children from higher grades (1491ms versus 1577ms; F(1,11)=8.11,
      p=0.016), but not in children from lower grades (2289ms versus 2417ms; F(1,10)=2.66,
      p=0.134) and intermediate grades (1530 versus 1509ms; F(1,10)=0.01, p=0.941).
      No operator-priming effect for multiplication was observed in any groups (lower
      grades: F(1,10)=3.50, p=0.091; intermediate grades: F(1,10)=1.52, p=0.246; higher
      grades: F(1,11)=0.14, p=0.715). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial
      evidence for an operator-priming effect with addition problems in children from
      higher grades (BF10=4.08), but no evidence in children from intermediate (BF10=0.30)
      and lower (BF10=0.83) grades. There was also no or anecdotal evidence for an
      operator-priming effect with multiplication problems in any group (higher grades:
      BF10=0.31; intermediate grades: BF10=0.55; lower grades: BF10=1.09).Second,
      we tested whether the size of the operator-priming effect in children (measured
      on small problems) was correlated to the magnitude of the response for addition
      sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials in the right hippocampus.
      Such a correlation was found to be highly significant in children from higher
      grades (r=0.82, p=0.0012, Fig. 4), surviving Bonferroni correction for multiple
      comparisons between the two conditions and across the three groups (pcorr=0.007).
      That is, children from higher grades who show greater responses to + signs in
      the right hippocampus are those who show larger operator-priming effect with
      addition problems. No significant correlation was found in children from lower
      (r=0.15, p=0.66 Fig. 4) and intermediate (r=0.24, p=0.48, Fig. 4) grades. Bayes
      Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for the correlation in children
      from higher grades (BF10=38.15), but no evidence in children from lower (BF10=0.40)
      and intermediate (BF10=0.46) grades. There was also no significant (and anecdotal
      evidence for a) correlation between the operator-priming effect for addition
      problems and the fMRI response to multiplication sign-only trials (compared
      to baseline sign-only trials) in the right hippocampus, in any of the groups
      (lower grades: r=0.06, p=0.87, BF10=0.37; intermediate grades: r=0.32, p=0.34,
      BF10=0.56; higher grades: r=0.51, p=0.09, BF10=1.28). Therefore, not only did
      we observe an operator-priming effect for addition in the only group in which
      we also observed a greater hippocampal response to + than  signs (i.e., children
      from higher grades), but inter-individual differences in the size of the operator-priming
      effect in that group was also related to hippocampal activity.Open in a separate
      windowFig. 4Hippocampus brain-behavior correlation over grade.Activity in the
      right hippocampus in response to addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials as a function of the operator-priming effect calculated in the behavioral
      session for addition problems in children from lower (n=11; grade 3.25.4; mean
      grade=4.4; mean age=9.4), intermediate (n=11; grade 5.66.9; mean grade=6.2;
      mean age=11.1) and higher grades (n=12; grade 7.610.2; mean grade=8.5; mean
      age=13.4). r represents the Pearson correlation coefficient.Third, we tested
      whether the correlation between the operator-priming effect and the contrast
      of addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials increased over
      grade. This was done by transforming the correlation coefficient in each group
      to a Fischers z score before comparing the groups using the cocor package (Diedenhofen
      and Musch, 2015). Although the correlation was not greater in children from
      intermediate than lower grades (z=0.19, p=0.43, one-tailed), it was significantly
      greater in children from higher than lower grades (z=2.07, p=0.019, one-tailed)
      and in children from higher than intermediate grades (z=1.88, p=0.030, one-tailed).
      Therefore, this brain-behavior correlation increased over grade.4.DiscussionIn
      the present study, we used fMRI and a cross-sectional design to investigate
      (i) how and when spatial processing related to the perception of an addition
      sign emerges in the developing brain, and (ii) to what extent it contributes
      to the emergence of an operator-priming effect.4.1. The mere perception of a
      + sign is associated with increased hippocampal spatial activity throughout
      age and/or educationIt has been shown that the processing of a + sign is associated
      with the right side of space (Pinhas et al., 2014) and activates brain regions
      involved in overt spatial attention in adults (Mathieu et al., 2017). Therefore,
      we expected arithmetic learning to be associated with increased recruitment
      of brain regions involved in spatial attention in response to the perception
      of a + sign throughout age and/or education in children. This was the case in
      a region of the right hippocampus that we identified in our spatial attention
      localizer task. Therefore, it is possible that hippocampal spatial mechanisms
      may scaffold the progressive association between an arithmetic operator (i.e.,
      a + sign) and spatial intuitions throughout age and/or education. There is increasing
      evidence that the hippocampal formation, and particularly the right hippocampus,
      may house a sense of space (Buffalo, 2015). Specifically, the right hippocampus
      has been extensively reported to support spatial representation and navigation
      in humans (Maguire et al., 1998, Burgess et al., 2002) as well as in non-human
      primates and rodents (O''keefe and Nadel, 1978, Bird and Burgess, 2008). For
      example, the hippocampus is typically activated when human participants learn
      to navigate through a mental representation of space (i.e., mental scanning)
      (Mellet et al., 2002, Spiers and Maguire, 2006). Interestingly, a recent study
      in monkeys demonstrated that neurons in the hippocampal formation may encode
      the direction of overt (Killian et al., 2015) as well as covert (Wilming et
      al., 2015) shifts of attention. Therefore, the hippocampal formation is likely
      a critical region for both representing a mental map of space and navigating
      along that map (Killian et al., 2012, Meister and Buffalo, 2016).Why would such
      a hippocampal spatial navigation mechanism be increasingly recruited by the
      mere perception of a+ sign throughout age and/or education? One possibility
      is that this mechanism might enable children to construct a detailed representation
      of numbers in mental space, as well as to navigate along that mental representation.
      Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence that numbers of increasing size are organized
      along a left-to-right mental map (i.e., the MNL) in adults (Fischer and Shaki
      2014). This spatial representation may enable individuals to add or subtract
      numbers by navigating from a source to a target number to the left or right
      of that MNL. This is supported by behavioral studies showing that addition and
      subtraction problem-solving is associated with rightward and leftward shifts
      of attention (Masson and Pesenti, 2014, Mathieu et al., 2016), as well as by
      a neuroimaging study indicating an overlap between the brain regions involved
      in overt shifts of attention and those involved in arithmetic calculation in
      adults (Knops et al., 2009). Such strategies may be acquired early by children,
      sometimes even explicitly in the classroom where addition and subtraction is
      often demonstrated on visual number lines. Yet, it is only with practice that
      they might become progressively attached to and evoked by an arithmetic operator
      such as a +, which might explain the grade-related increases of activity in
      this region in response to the + sign (and the fact that it is only by 7th grade
      that children exhibit significant activity in response to that sign).4.2. Hippocampal
      spatial activity in response to a + sign relates to the operator-priming effect
      in children from higher gradesA critical question is to what extent this automatic
      processing of a + sign in hippocampal spatial mechanisms is associated with
      childrens behavior. To answer this question, we asked all children to perform
      a version of the operator-priming task developed by Fayol and Thevenot (2012)
      and Roussel et al. (2002). First, we replicated the operator-priming effect
      observed in adults with addition problems (i.e., a facilitation of problem-solving
      when the operator is presented 150ms before the operands), but only in children
      from higher grades (after around 7th grade). Like in adults, this effect was
      specific to addition problems and not observed with multiplication problems.
      Thus, the perception of a + sign (but not that of a  sign) appears to pre-activate
      a process that is likely used to solve the subsequent problem in children from
      higher grades. More central to our current interest, we found that the size
      of the operator-priming effect in these children was highly correlated with
      the degree of activation of hippocampal spatial mechanisms in response to a
      + sign. This indicates that hippocampal spatial activity may be at the source
      of the operator priming-effect in older children, perhaps because these children
      might prepare for an attentional movement along the MNL as soon as a + sign
      is presented. Because no brain-behavior correlation was observed in younger
      children, extensive practice might be needed before such mechanisms are triggered
      by the mere perception of the sign.4.3. Hippocampal spatial activity in response
      to a + sign is transient in developmentStrikingly, the spatial brain mechanisms
      that respond to the mere perception of a + sign appear to be different in children
      and adults. That is, albeit we found increased hippocampal spatial activity
      throughout age and/or education in the present study, we did not identify these
      mechanisms in our previous study in adult participants using the exact same
      task (Mathieu et al., 2017). Rather, we found increased activity in response
      to a + sign in neocortical regions of the FEF and PSPL in adults. Therefore,
      the contribution of the hippocampus to the automatic processing of a + sign
      is likely transient. Such a transient involvement of the hippocampus is consistent
      with a wealth of studies that have demonstrated that the spatial representations
      initially supported by the hippocampus during learning become independent from
      this brain structure over experience and transferred to neocortical regions
      (Rosenbaum et al., 2004, Hirshhorn et al., 2012b). For example, longitudinal
      studies demonstrate that right hippocampal activity associated with learning
      to mentally navigate through a new environment disappears and is replaced by
      neocortical activity when individuals become familiar with that environment
      (Spiers and Maguire, 2007, Hirshhorn et al., 2012a). It is possible that the
      same phenomenon is at play here: The hippocampus may be involved in the early
      representation of (and navigation along) the MNL before that representation
      is transferred to neocortical regions of the fronto-parietal cortex. Future
      investigations with a wider age sample than in the present study are needed
      to test this hypothesis.4.4. Can right hippocampal involvement in the present
      study reflect mnemonic operations involved in learning arithmetic?Although there
      is no doubt that the hippocampus supports spatial processing (Burgess et al.,
      2002, Spiers and Maguire, 2007), this brain structure is also well known to
      support the encoding and consolidation of verbal declarative knowledge into
      long-term memory (Eichenbaum, 2004). In fact, previous developmental studies
      have largely explained the involvement of the hippocampus during arithmetic
      learning by referring to its role in declarative memory rather than spatial
      processing (Rivera et al., 2005, De Smedt et al., 2011, Cho et al., 2011, Cho
      et al., 2012, Qin et al., 2014). This interpretation relies on the claim that
      results of well-practiced arithmetic facts (e.g., 2+3 or 42) might become progressively
      retrieved from memory (rather than calculated) over the course of learning and
      development (Campbell and Xue, 2001). The hippocampus might thus support the
      encoding and consolidation of networks of arithmetic facts in children.Can the
      role of the hippocampus in declarative memory explain the operator-specific
      activity over grade (and correlation with the operator-priming effect) observed
      in the region of the right hippocampus identified by our spatial localizer task?
      We acknowledge that we did not have a task identifying processes involved in
      declarative memory. Thus, even if the right hippocampus is usually more associated
      with spatial than mnemonic processes (Burgess et al., 2002), it is possible
      that the hippocampal cluster that we identified as being involved in spatial
      processing may also be involved in some aspects of declarative memory. One might
      thus argue that grade-related increases of activity in relation to + signs reflect
      the progressive association between a + and a network of additive facts. This
      explanation, however, can be ruled out by an examination of activity related
      to  signs. Because single-digit multiplication problems are almost exclusively
      learned by rote in school, multiplication is the operation that is perhaps the
      most associated with a network of stored facts in the literature (Campbell and
      Xue, 2001). Thus, if increased hippocampal activity in relation to + signs were
      due to the progressive building of a network of additive facts, increased activity
      in that same region should have been observed during the perception of  signs
      (perhaps even more so for the perception of + signs). Yet, this is not the case.
      Not only did we not find any grade-related increase of activity for  signs in
      the hippocampal cluster identified by our spatial localizer task, but activity
      was significantly greater for + than  signs in higher graders (who are as proficient
      in single-digit multiplication as addition). Similarly, no operator-priming
      effect was observed for multiplication problems in higher graders, indicating
      that the operator-priming effect observed for addition is likely to have little
      to do with the pre-activation of a network of stored facts (because this should
      be also observed for multiplication). Therefore, the specificity of our results
      to + signs (as compared to  signs) in the right hippocampus ROI makes it very
      unlikely that our results are related to mnemonic operations. In our view, emerging
      associations between + signs and spatial intuitions related to the MNL are the
      best explanation of the effects reported here.Of course, the fact that the role
      of the hippocampus in declarative memory is unlikely to explain our operator-specific
      findings in the right hippocampus ROI does not mean that hippocampal mechanisms
      supporting mnemonic operations do not contribute to arithmetic learning. Instead,
      they indicate that the hippocampus might contribute to arithmetic learning through
      its role in both declarative memory and spatial processing. Interestingly, the
      operator-specific activity observed in our (spatially localized) right hippocampal
      cluster is not observed in a mirror (left lateralized) cluster that is not activated
      in the localizer contrast (see Supplementary information). In that mirror region,
      no difference was observed between activity related to + and  signs in any group
      of children (and left hippocampal activity was not related to the operator-priming
      effect). Thus, the developmental effect reported here appears to be restricted
      to the right hippocampus. This specificity suggests that the observed developmental
      changes in the right hippocampus may not simply reflect general brain maturation
      but rather mechanisms that are specific to arithmetic learning.4.5. LimitationsIt
      is worth acknowledging here 2 potential limitations of the present work. First,
      as is the case for any cross-sectional fMRI studies, our study is correlational
      in nature. Thus, although our findings are consistent with the idea that the
      right hippocampus might scaffold the progressive association between (at least
      some) arithmetic operators and space throughout age and/or education, future
      studies might specifically investigate the causal role of these hippocampal
      mechanisms. Second, our finding of a correlation between grade and the processing
      of an addition sign in the right hippocampus (see Fig. 3C) relies on a relatively
      large sample size of 34 children. However, other findings involve subgroups
      of participants and therefore rely on smaller sample sizes. In particular, null
      findings in relation to these subgroups might be difficult to interpret because
      of potential lack of power. For example, whereas we found an operator-priming
      effect in children from higher grades and no effect in children from intermediate
      grades, there was no significant difference between these groups in terms of
      response times in negative SOA trials (1491ms versus 1530ms; t21=0.21; p=0.84;
      BF10=0.39). Behavioral studies focusing on the operator-priming effect in children
      might test whether this difference emerges with larger sample sizes. More generally,
      future studies are needed to improve our understanding of the present results.5.ConclusionIn
      sum, our findings suggest that the right hippocampus might contribute to the
      progressive association between (at least some) arithmetic operators and space
      throughout age and/or education. Therefore, our study raises the possibility
      that increased hippocampal activity during arithmetic learning in children may
      be explained by the role of this structure in spatial representations as well
      as in declarative memory.Conflict of interestThe authors declare no competing
      financial interests.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by a grant from
      the European Union (Marie Curie Career Integration Grant n PCIG12-GA-2012-333602)
      to J.P. and a grant from the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research
      to R.M. We thank the Hospices Civils de Lyon for sponsoring the research, as
      well as Flora Schwartz and the MRI engineers (Franck Lamberton and Danielle
      Ibarrola) at the CERMEP-Lyon platform for their assistance in collecting the
      fMRI data. Finally, we are grateful to Pr. Christian Scheiber for his help with
      the pre-MRI medical exams.Footnotes1Note that to induce an arithmetic context
      and disguise the goal of the experiment, we also included trials in which a
      + or a  sign was followed 150ms later by operands and participants were asked
      to solve the problem. The low temporal resolution of fMRI, however, makes it
      impossible to dissociate activity associated with the sign from activity associated
      with operands in these problems. Therefore, they were simply designed to be
      filler trials.2There was a tendency for a correlation between grade and activity
      associated with addition sign-only trials (versus fixation) in the right hippocampus
      (r=0.29, p=0.09; BF10=0.82), but no correlation for baseline sign-only trials
      (versus fixation) (r=0.10, p=0.58; BF10=0.25). Thus, the correlation between
      grade and the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials was more likely driven by changes of activity in addition sign-only trials
      than in baseline sign-only trials.Appendix ASupplementary data associated with

      Significance Statement \n  \nPsychopathic criminals are commonly seen as instrumentally
      abusive and emotionally callous, yet social challenges often trigger uncontrolled
      emotional behavior in those individuals. This study shows how this paradoxical
      aspect of psychopathy relates to altered neuroendocrine interactions between
      testosterone and the cerebral circuit coordinating emotional action tendencies.
      The anterior prefrontal cortex, a region necessary for controlling emotional
      behavior, showed blunted responses and reduced connectivity with the amygdala
      in psychopathic criminals engaged in controlling their emotional action tendencies.
      This cerebral pattern was strongest in psychopathic individuals with high endogenous
      testosterone levels. This neuroendocrine signature of altered emotional control
      highlights the relevance of considering the testosterone level of individual
      psychopathic patients during treatment of their impulsive behavior. \n\n\n##
      Introduction \n  \nPsychopathy is a disorder often associated with blunted emotional
      responding and increased goal-directed behavior ( ;  ). On the other hand, offenders
      with psychopathy also show a paradoxical increase in impulsive behavior and
      uncontrolled aggression after emotional provocations ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), which
      may be related to heightened testosterone levels ( ;  ). These two aspects of
      psychopathy are also distinguished within the most commonly used psychopathy
      checklist, the Psychopathy Check List-Revised (PCL-R), potentially reflecting
      differing traits among psychopathic individuals ( ;  ). Importantly, enhanced
      difficulty in controlling emotional impulses, a crucial component of criminal
      psychopathy associated with PCL-R factor 2, has been largely neglected by cognitive
      neuroscience. Yet, the clinical relevance of this cognitive trait is large:
      reduced behavioral control and increased impulsivity predict recidivism in psychopathic
      offenders ( ), and behavioral control in psychopathic offenders appears particularly
      fragile when dealing with emotionally relevant behavior ( ;  , chapter 7;  ).
      Accordingly, understanding the neurobiological systems underlying the altered
      control of social emotional behavior in psychopathic individuals is relevant
      for improving currently available interventions, which are plagued by low treatment
      response and high recidivism ( ). Here we study those neuroendocrine systems
      in a group of psychopathic offenders engaged in an experimental paradigm that
      requires rule-driven control of emotional behavior. \n\nPrevious investigations
      of psychopathy showed altered reactivity to emotional material in several brain
      regions that include the anterior part of the PFC (aPFC) and the amygdala (
      ;  ;  ). Furthermore, individuals with psychopathy showed decreased functional
      and anatomical connectivity between the PFC and amygdala at rest ( ;  ), an
      indication that these brain regions might have a reduced ability to interact
      effectively. Studies in healthy participants have shown that this cerebral circuit
      is necessary for implementing the control of emotionally relevant actions (
      ). Namely, aPFC downregulates neural processing in the amygdala during emotional
      control ( ), while high levels of endogenous testosterone reduce such control-related
      connectivity between aPFC and amygdala ( ). Those findings raise the possibility
      that aPFCamygdala connectivity is altered when psychopathic offenders need to
      control emotionally relevant actions, with high levels of endogenous testosterone
      exacerbating that altered connectivity. \n\nThis study tests these hypotheses
      by measuring brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      in 15 psychopathic criminals and 19 matched healthy control subjects dealing
      with a challenge to control their emotional behavior. The psychopathy sample
      was obtained by focused and comprehensive screening excluding confounds that
      are frequently associated with random criminal sampling (e.g., medication use,
      comorbidity). The social approachavoidance (AA) task was used to provide reliable
      indexes of control over social emotional behavior ( ;  ;  , ). Behaviorally,
      psychopathic participants previously showed altered AA behavior to explicitly
      approaching and avoiding emotional faces ( ). Similar findings occurred after
      testosterone administration in healthy participants ( ). Interestingly, a more
      subtle version of the AA task has been shown to be sensitive to testosterone-related
      alterations and genetic variations in the aPFCamygdala pathway, while keeping
      behavior constant across experimental groups ( ), opening the way for isolating
      neural vulnerability factors ( ) in psychopathy. During this task, participants
      respond to affective faces (happy, angry) presented for a short time with approach
      and avoidance movements. Automatic emotional tendencies (approachhappy and avoidangry
      faces; affect-congruent response conditions) need to be controlled during affect-incongruent
      response conditions in order to apply the counterintuitive action of approaching
      angry and avoiding happy faces ( ;  ). Healthy participants respond more slowly
      and rely more strongly on the aPFC when emotional control is required, operationalized
      by the differences evoked between affect-incongruent and affect-congruent trials
      ( ;  ). Accordingly, this study tests whether exerting control over emotionally
      relevant actions is reflected by reduced functionality of the aPFCamygdala circuit
      in psychopathic individuals, suggesting less prefrontal regulation of emotional
      actions. In addition, it sets out to test whether this alteration is intensified
      by high levels of endogenous testosterone. \n  \nThe emotional control AA task.
      The AA task involved the presentation of happy and angry faces, and the performance
      of approach and avoidance responses. During the AA task, the participants had
      to select their response according to the perceived emotion of the face. At
      the beginning of each block of 12 trials, the participants received instructions
      on whether to pull the joystick toward themselves (approach) or push it away
      (avoid) when seeing a face with a particular emotion. When viewing happy or
      angry faces, automatic stimulusresponse tendencies trigger corresponding approach
      or avoidance actions. These tendencies could be followed during the affect-congruent
      condition (approachhappy, avoidangry). In contrast, when task instructions required
      participants to avoid happy faces or to approach angry faces, automatic tendencies
      needed to be controlled and overridden with the instructed response (affect-incongruent
      condition). Participants saw the faces and moved the joystick while lying in
      a MR scanner (top left corner of the table). Figure adapted from  ). \n  \n\n##
      Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe psychopathic group was
      recruited from in-patient populations of the Pompestichting and Oldenkotte,
      forensic psychiatric institutes (TBS-clinics) in the Netherlands. TBS-clinics
      are facilities for criminal offenders with a mental disorder treated on behalf
      of the state. \n\nSeventeen male psychopathic violent offenders (age range,
      23-56 years) participated; all had received a diagnosis with a PCL-R score of
      26, according to European standards ( ;  ;  ). PCL-R consensus scores were obtained
      by trained clinicians based on a structured PCL-R interview, clinical status,
      and history. After the independent scoring, the two raters compared their scores
      and came to the consensus score. When no consensus could be found, a third independent
      rater was included in the process. Dutch versions of the National Adult Reading
      Test and Edinburgh Handedness Inventory were used to assess IQ levels and right-handedness
      ( ;  ). Twenty-one healthy male control subjects (HCs) matched for age, right-handedness,
      and IQ, without criminal records or history of psychiatric disorders, were recruited
      from staff of the clinics. All participants received oral and written information
      about the experiment and gave written informed consent according to guidelines
      of the local ethics committee (Commissie Mensengebonden Onderzoek region Arnhem-Nijmegen).
      Psychiatric exclusion criteria consisted of neurological, axis-I, and axis-II
      disorders, besides antisocial personality disorder for the psychopathic group.
      They were screened for these exclusion criteria by trained psychologists using
      Dutch versions of the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID;  ) and Mini-International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI;  ) for   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      of Mental Disorders  , 4th edition, disorders. All participants were asked about
      drug use and medical/neurological history to exclude the following: alcohol
      use of >3 units/day, cannabis, or other illicit drug use 1 week before, psychotropic
      medication other than oxazepam 5 d before, 1 unit of alcohol or oxazepam use
      within 24 h before the experiment; history of trauma capitis; visual and auditive
      disorder; and neurological disorder. Furthermore, general exclusion criteria
      for MRI experiments were applied. Two psychopathic patients (PPs) and two HCs
      were excluded from the analyses, due to incomplete scanning procedures (1 PP,
      1 HC) or too many errors on the task (>16%, representing the outlier with a   z  -score
      >3). The final groups did not differ in age, IQ, and handedness (see  ). \n  \nDemographical
      data \n    \n\n### Procedure \n  \nTwo test sessions took place. During the
      first session, right-handedness, IQ, MINI, and SCID were assessed. During the
      second session, participants completed several questionnaires upon arrival in
      the laboratory, including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to measure
      anxiety levels ( ). Next, they provided saliva for the testosterone measurement.
      Afterward, participants were positioned in the 1.5 T MR scanner and familiarized
      with the task setup. Immediately after this, the fMRI session started with the
      AA task (duration, 30 min) followed by another task (not included in this report).
      After a short break outside the scanner, the anatomical scan (duration, 5 min)
      and an unrelated task were acquired in the side-by-side 3 T MR scanner. \n\n\n###
      Experimental task \n  \nThe AA task consisted of 24 blocks (with 12 trials per
      block and a baseline period of 21-24 s) during which participants had to respond
      to visually presented faces either by pulling a joystick toward themselves (approach)
      or by pushing it away from themselves (avoid;  ). The participants had to categorize
      faces as happy, angry, and neutral (filler items), based on their affective
      expressions. During each block, two of the three affective expressions were
      presented as stimuli, because only two responses could be given to categorize
      the stimulus. This resulted in six different block types each used four times,
      representing the affect (happyangry, happyneutral, angryneutral)  movement (approachavoid)
      combinations. At the start of each block, participants received written instructions
      regarding the required response mapping. The affect  movement combinations were
      pseudorandomly and evenly distributed (with no affect combination repetition),
      and the combination of the first block was counterbalanced across participants.
      Within each block, affective expressions and gender types were pseudorandomly
      presented, avoiding three or more sequential presentations of the same expression/gender,
      and two presentations of the same facial model. Each face was presented for
      100 ms, preceded by a 300 ms blank screen, and followed by the participants
      response, a blank screen, and by a pseudorandom intertrial interval (ITI; 1-3
      s). A baseline period of 21-24 s preceded each block. The faces were from 36
      models (18 male) obtained from several databases ( ;  ;  ; ), each showing all
      expressions. The pictures were in grayscale, matched for brightness and contrast
      values, and displayed against a black background. To exclude influence from
      hair and nonfacial contours, the faces were trimmed. Joystick displacements
      of >80% along the sagittal plane within 2 s from stimulus presentation were
      marked as valid responses. Invalid responses were signaled for 1 s with written
      feedback stating you did not move your joystick far enough. After moving the
      joystick, participants had to return to the starting position (defined as the
      central area extending 20% along the sagittal plane) before the end of the ITI.
      Otherwise, visual feedback indicated return the joystick to the starting position,
      and the ITI was repeated after participants returned the joystick. The training
      at the beginning consisted of six blocks; one block of eight trials for each
      of the six affect  movement combinations. Different visual stimuli were used
      during the training and scanning blocks. \n\n\n### Materials and apparatus \n  \nThe
      fMR images were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner (Avanto, Siemens Medical Systems)
      with an eight-channel head coil using a multiecho generalized autocalibrating
      partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) sequence [ ; repetition time (TR),
      2.14 ms; five echo times (TEs), 9.4/21/33/44/56 ms; 34 transversal slices; ascending
      acquisition; distance factor, 17%; effective voxel size, 3.3  3.3  3.5 mm; field
      of view (FOV), 212 mm]. High-resolution anatomical images were acquired on a
      3 T MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil using a magnetization prepared rapid
      gradient echo sequence (TR, 2300 ms; TE, 3.03 ms; 192 sagittal slices; voxel
      size, 1.0  1.0  1.0 mm; FOV, 256 mm). \n\nAn MR-compatible joystick (Fiber Optic
      Joystick, Current Designs; sampling rate, 550 Hz) was placed on participants
      abdomens to ensure comfortable push-and-pull movements ( ). Participants wore
      MR-compatible headphones to reduce scanner noise (Commander XG MRI Audio System,
      Resonance Technologies). Stimuli were projected at the center of a screen, viewed
      via a mirror above the participants head, with a visual angle of 4  6 (width  height).
      Stimuli presentation and acquisition of joystick positions were controlled by
      a PC running Presentation version 13 ( ). \n\n\n### Salivary measurements \n  \nParticipants
      filled two Salicaps (IBL) with saliva for testosterone measurement, which were
      stored at 25C. Testosterone concentration was measured using competitive chemiluminescence
      immunoassay with a sensitivity of 0.0025 ng/ml (IBL International, Tecan). Intra-assay
      and interassay coefficients are between 10% and 12%. To control variables influencing
      testosterone levels, participants were instructed to refrain from any food,
      cigarettes, and drinks (except water) for 1 h before the experiment. \n\n\n###
      Behavioral analysis \n  \nBehavioral data was analyzed using MATLAB version
      7.9 (MathWorks) and PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc.). First, to obtain a precise
      measure of movement onset [reaction time (RT)], the joystick movement for each
      trial was reconstructed using the joystick displacement measurements. Excluded
      trials showed a joystick movement in the wrong direction, an extreme RT (<150
      or >1500 ms), peak velocity (<0.1 cm/s), or movement time (>400 ms); or an error
      rate of above chance level in a block (in that case, the whole block was excluded).
      RTs and testosterone levels were log transformed to obtain a normal distribution.
      Second, following previous studies ( ;  ), we conducted three-way repeated-measures
      ANOVA (ANCOVArm) on the mean RT and error rates, with factors group (PP, HC),
      movement (approach, avoid), and valence (happy, angry), including standardized
      testosterone and STAI state as covariate. A measure of anxiety (STAI) was included
      to account for the effects of psychopathy type (e.g., primary vs secondary);
      and the possible effects on emotional behavior, hormonal levels, amygdala, and
      prefrontal cortex functioning ( ;  ;  ; ). The -level was set at   p   < 0.05.
      \n\n\n### Functional MRI data \n  \n#### Single-subject analyses \n  \nImaging
      data were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping;  ).
      The first four volumes of each participants dataset were discarded to allow
      for   T   equilibration. Given the multiecho GRAPPA MR sequence (Poser et al.,
      2006), head motion parameters were estimated on MR images with the shortest
      TE (9.4 ms), since these are least affected by possible artifacts. These motion
      correction parameters, estimated using a least-squares approach with six rigid
      body transformation parameters (translations, rotations), were applied to the
      five echo images collected for each excitation. After spatial realignment, the
      five echo images were combined into a single MR volume using an optimized echo
      weighting method (Poser et al., 2006). The time series for each voxel was temporally
      realigned to the first slice in time. The   T  -weighted image was spatially
      coregistered to the mean of the functional images. The fMRI time series were
      transformed and resampled at an isotropic voxel size of 2 mm into standard Montreal
      Neurological Institute (MNI) space by unified segmentation and normalization
      using the coregistered   T  -weighted image ( ). The normalized functional images
      were spatially smoothed using an isotropic 8 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian
      kernel. \n\nThe fMRI time series of each subject were further analyzed using
      an event-related approach in the context of general linear model, including
      the following effects: approachhappy, approachneutral, approachangry, avoidhappy,
      avoidneutral, and avoidangry. Trials excluded from behavioral analyses and periods
      of instructions or feedback were modeled as regressors. Vectors describing the
      time of picture presentation (onset) and RT of each event (duration) were convolved
      with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Potential confounding effects
      of residual head movement were modeled using original, squared, cubic, first-order,
      and second-order derivatives of the movement correction parameters ( ). Three
      further regressors, describing the time course of signal intensities of white
      matter, CSF, and the portion of the MR image outside the skull were also added.
      This procedure accounts for image intensity shifts due to hand movements within
      or near the magnetic field of the scanner ( ). Finally, fMRI time series were
      high-pass filtered (cutoff 120 s). Temporal autocorrelation was modeled as a
      first-order autoregressive process. \n\n\n#### Group analyses \n  \nConsistent
      effects across participants and between groups were tested using a random-effects
      multiple regression analysis that included six contrast images (approachhappy,
      approachneutral, approachangry, avoidhappy, avoidneutral, avoidangry) per participant.
      Together, these images represented the estimated cerebral effects from 12 conditions
      of the experimental design [group (PP, HC)  valence (happy, neutral, angry)  response
      (approach, avoid)]. Standardized log-transformed testosterone and standardized
      STAI state levels were included in the multiple regression analysis as condition-specific
      [group (PP, HC)  valence (happy, neutral, angry)  response (approach, avoid)]
      regressors, generating another 12 regressors per variable. \n\nAll analyses
      assessed the congruency effect, reflecting task-related differences of affect-incongruent
      (approachangry, avoidhappy) versus affect-congruent trials (approachhappy, avoidangry;  ;  ).
      We considered two effects. First, to test for general effects of congruency,
      we performed an analysis on the congruency effect over both groups and for each
      group separately. When assessing the effects of one group explicitly, we also
      tested whether those effects were specific to that group and were significantly
      weaker in the other group (at   p   < 0.05 uncorrected) by masking the statistical
      map describing the congruency effect in the first group (using multiple comparisons
      correction, see below) with the statistical map describing the group  congruency
      contrast. Second, to test whether testosterone differentially modulated the
      control of emotionally relevant actions in the groups, we performed a group  congruency
      contrast on the regressor parametrizing interindividual differences in testosterone
      on task-related conditions. If such an interaction is present, the testosterone
      modulation on the congruency effect of each group separately is considered.
      In addition to whole-brain analyses, we used a volume of interest (VOI) on coordinates
      previously found to be modulated by testosterone during the congruency effect
      in healthy students (two 8-mm-radius spheres centered on the following MNI coordinates:   x  ,
      30;   y  , 58; and z, 2; and   x  , 32;   y  , 54; and   z  , 8;  ). \n\nThe
      reported activations are corrected for multiple comparisons using familywise
      error (FWE) correction. For whole-brain analyses, we made inferences at cluster
      level (FWE:   p   < 0.05, corresponding to a cluster size of >140 on the basis
      of intensity threshold,   p   < 0.001). For VOI analyses, we made inferences
      at voxel-level (FWE corrected,   p   < 0.05;  ;  ). Anatomical inference is
      drawn by superimposing SPM showing significant signal changes on structural
      images of participants. For anatomical accuracy, we report only activation peaks
      in gray matter. Anatomical landmarks were identified using the atlas of  . Brodmann
      areas (BAs) were assigned by superimposing significant SPM on the SPM anatomy
      toolbox ( ) and MRIcron template ( /). \n\n\n\n### Connectivity analyses \n  \nThe
      aim of the following analysis was to test whether inter-regional coupling of
      the aPFC (see Results) with the amygdala and other brain regions during the
      congruency effect was different between the groups and modulated by testosterone.
      To test for these effects, we used the psychophysiological interactions (PPIs)
      method ( ). More specifically, we tested for significant differences between
      the regression coefficients of each voxel over the right aPFC during the affect-incongruent
      versus the affect-congruent conditions. To select voxels to be included in the
      VOI, we used the following anatomical constraints ( ): for each participant,
      selected voxels fell within a sphere with a radius of 4 mm around the peak voxel
      corresponding to the activated cluster of the congruency effect over both groups
      (coordinates:   x  , 30;   y  , 58;   z  , 14; see Results). Participant specific
      contrast images were generated describing the PPI between the time courses of
      the right aPFC VOI and affect-incongruent versus affect-congruent conditions.
      Group differences and testosterone modulations on task-related coupling between
      the aPFC and other regions were then assessed using a multiple regression design
      on participant-specific contrast images with their corresponding testosterone
      (log-transformed, standardized) and STAI state (standardized) levels as subject-
      and group-specific regressors. In addition to whole-brain analyses, we assessed
      significant voxel-level effects (FWE corrected for multiple comparisons,   p   <
      0.05) within the amygdala, defined on the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas
      ( ) using the WFU PickAtlas tool ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral
      results \n  \nFifteen psychopathic criminals (PPs; PCL-R score of 26, according
      to European standards ( ;  ;  ) and 19 HCs (for demographics, see  ) were included
      in the analyses. Participants performed the task accurately and consistently
      (error rates: PPs, 7.9%; HCs, 7.3%; omissions: PPs, 1.6%; HCs, 1.5%; undefined
      responses: PPs, 0.9%; HCs, 0.3%;  ). \n  \nRTs and error rates for each group
      and factor of the AA task \n    \nA significant movement  valence interaction
      for the RTs indicated that, over groups, participants responded more slowly
      during affect-incongruent (approachangry, avoidhappy) than during affect-congruent
      trials (approachhappy, avoidangry;   F   = 10.4,   p   = 0.003;  ). This congruency
      effect replicates the behavioral results from previous fMRI studies ( ;  ).
      Furthermore, there were main effects of movement (  F   = 26.3,   p   < 0.001)
      and valence (  F   = 28.7,   p   < 0.001), reflecting the slowing of avoidance
      movements and responses to angry faces in general ( ). There were no significant
      effects involving group, including no main effect (  p   > 0.3). The congruency
      effect correlated positively (without corrections for multiple comparisons)
      with the PCL-R total score (  p   = 0.048,   R   = 0.517, respectively). Excluding
      anxiety from the analyses did not affect the outcomes. Moreover, when including
      the neutral conditions in the analyses, the movement  valence (happy, neutral,
      angry) interaction for RTs remained significant (  F   = 5.5,   p   = 0.010),
      showing that neutral approachavoidance effects are intermediary compared with
      happy and angry ( ). \n  \nBehavioral results. Mean RTs (SEM) for the affect-congruent
      and affect-incongruent conditions of the AA task for the healthy control subjects
      and psychopathic offenders. The groups were significantly slower to provide
      affect-incongruent responses (approachangry; avoidhappy) than affect-congruent
      responses (approachhappy; avoidangry), with no significant group differences.
      \n  \nFor the error rates, the three-way ANCOVArm showed main effects of movement
      (  F   = 27.5,   p   < 0.001), valence (  F   = 25.9,   p   < 0.001), and testosterone
      (  F   = 4.6,   p   = 0.040), and a valence  testosterone interaction (  F   =
      4.3,   p   = 0.047). There were no other significant effects for the error rates
      (  p   > 0.15). \n\nEndogenous testosterone levels [median (SD): PPs, 101 pg/ml
      (70 pg/ml); HCs, 90 pg/ml (46 pg/ml)] and state anxiety levels [STAI mean (SD):
      PPs, 32 (8); HCs, 32 (5)] did not differ between groups (  p   > 0.4), and showed
      no correlations with psychopathy (PCL-R) scores or with each other (  p   >
      0.1). \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### Multiple regression analyses \n  \nTo
      assess the two main questions of this study, we isolated cerebral structures
      showing stronger responses during affect-incongruent than affect-congruent trials
      (congruency effect), and cerebral structures in which the congruency effect
      was modulated by testosterone levels. \n\nThe results showed a significant congruency
      effect across groups in the aPFC [ROI analysis: MNI coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ):
      (30, 58, 14) and (30 58 10);   p   = 0.001 and 0.036;   t   = 4.46 and 3.43;
      for further details, see  ]. As expected, this effect was driven by the healthy
      control group, and it was significantly weaker in the psychopathic offenders
      [  p   = 0.001 and 0.040;   t   = 4.58 and 3.40, on the congruency effect in
      healthy control subjects masked implicitly by group (HC > PP)  congruency interaction].
      The implicit masking demonstrates that the group  congruency interaction is
      also significant at   p   < 0.05 within the significant voxels corrected for
      multiple comparisons on the HC congruency effect. The psychopathy group showed
      no significant congruency effect in this region (  p   > 0.3). There was also
      a significant congruency effect across groups in the right superior parietal
      lobule (whole-brain analysis); this effect was driven mainly by the psychopathy
      group ( ). \n  \nClusters showing significantly larger activity for the affect-incongruent
      vs the affect-congruent conditions (emotion-control effect) \n    \nCritically,
      testosterone modulated the congruency effect in the aPFC differently in psychopathic
      offenders and healthy control subjects (whole-brain analysis on testosterone  group  congruency:
      MINI coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ): (30, 58, 12);   p   < 0.001;   t   =
      5.10; for all details, see  ).   Post hoc   analyses revealed that, in the psychopathy
      group, congruency effects decreased as testosterone levels increased [MNI coordinates
      (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ): (32, 56, 10) and (30, 58, 8);   p   = 0.002 and 0.015;   t   =
      4.34 and 3.74]. The modulatory effect of testosterone on congruency was absent
      in the healthy control subjects (  p    0.05;  ). The whole-brain analysis also
      showed an effect in the right caudate nucleus and right inferior supramarginal
      gyrus, driven by reduced congruency effects as a function of testosterone in
      the psychopathy group ( ;  ). \n  \nTestosterone modulations of the cerebral

      purposes. There are no outliers [Mahalanobis distances   D     < 4.2 (cutoff
      at   p   < 0.05;   D   = 7.74);  ;  ]. Healthy control subjects show an increased
      aPFC activity for the congruency effect and no modulation by testosterone, while
      in psychopathic offenders endogenous testosterone levels modulate the activity
      of the aPFC and right supramarginal gyrus. \n  \n\n#### Effective connectivity
      analyses \n  \nGiven the relevance of aPFCamygdala connectivity for implementing
      emotional control as evoked by the AA task ( ), we assessed whether psychopathy
      also resulted in altered connectivity along that neural pathway. Connectivity
      analyses using the right aPFC [4-mm-radius sphere; central voxel from main analysis
      (MNI coordinates:   x  , 30;   y  , 58;   z  , 14)] as the seed region on the
      congruency effect indicated a significant group difference (PP > HC) with the
      right amygdala ( ; ROI analysis; extent, 3 voxels;   t   = 3.82;   p   = 0.027;
      MNI coordinates of local maxima:   x  , 32;   y  , 0;   z  , 16). When testing
      effects for both groups separately, healthy control subjects showed a significant
      negative coupling between the right aPFC and amygdala (ROI analysis; extent:
      3 voxels,   t   = 3.70;   p   = 0.036; MNI coordinates of local maxima:   x  ,
      32;   y  , 0;   z  , 16), while psychopathic offenders showed no differential
      connectivity effect.   Post hoc   testing on right amygdala voxels showing the
      group interaction (threshold,   p   < 0.05 FWE) indicated a significant positive
      correlation with testosterone over both groups (ROI analysis; extent, 1 voxel;   t   =
      2.29;   p   = 0.029; MNI coordinates of local maxima:   x  , 32;   y  , 2;   z  ,
      16). There was no correlation between aPFCamygdala connectivity and the PCL-R
      scores (  p   > 0.2). \n  \nGroup difference on congruency-related aPFCamygdala

      control subjects, which is not present in the psychopathic offenders. \n  \n\n\n\n##
      Discussion \n  \nThis study indicates that psychopathic offenders show reduced
      aPFC activity as well as less aPFCamygdala connectivity during the control of
      emotional behavior. Emotional control was measured by comparing affect-incongruent
      and affect-congruent approachavoidance responses to emotional faces (congruency
      effect on the AA task;  ). When healthy control subjects exerted emotional control,
      reaction times, aPFC activity, and aPFCamygdala anticorrelations increased,
      confirming previous observations ( ). In contrast, psychopathic offenders did
      not show this typical control-related pattern of aPFC activity and connectivity.
      In addition, these effects were significantly modulated by endogenous testosterone.
      Namely, psychopathic individuals with relatively lower testosterone levels showed
      a neural activity and connectivity pattern that resembled the findings in healthy
      control subjects, while this pattern was absent in those with higher testosterone
      levels. This indicates that especially psychopathic individuals with high testosterone
      levels have less prefrontal regulation of amygdala-driven emotional actions
      when the control of emotional behavior is required. \n\n### Emotional control
      in psychopathy \n  \nImaging studies have illustrated an association between
      psychopathy and altered processing of fear, including altered amygdala responses
      ( ;  ;  ), attentional deficits for peripheral stimuli ( ), and moral/empathic
      insensitivity ( ;  ). However, psychopathic offenders also show clear impulsivity
      problems ( ), for example, when control is required during emotionally provoking
      situations. To address this relatively unexplored but crucial component of criminal
      psychopathy, we used a paradigm requiring rule-driven control of emotional actions.
      With this paradigm, it was possible to move beyond simple motor inhibition and
      to target the flexible control of emotionally driven action tendencies. \n\nFirst,
      the aPFC (also called BA 10) was less active in psychopathic offenders as a
      function of testosterone. The aPFC is a region crucial for the control of social
      emotional behavior. When aPFC functioning is temporarily disrupted, participants
      have increased difficulty in overriding emotional tendencies with rule-driven
      behavior ( ). Moreover, the aPFC seems especially important for integrating
      and coordinating multiple cognitive processes to facilitate response selection
      ( ;  ). For example, transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced reduction of
      aPFC functioning during the control of emotional behavior decreased activity
      in brain areas associated with rule selection (posterior parietal cortex), while
      both amygdala activity and automatic action tendencies increased ( ). The current
      study indicates that psychopathic individuals with especially high testosterone
      levels recruited the aPFC less when the control of emotional responses was needed.
      This finding suggests that they have reduced coordination of rule-based behavior
      with emotional information. \n\nSecond, connectivity between the aPFC and amygdala
      also differed significantly between groups. Healthy control subjects showed
      a negative aPFCamygdala coupling during the control of social emotional behavior,
      whereas psychopathic individuals showed no significant coupling between these
      regions. Evidence of anatomical connectivity alterations between these regions
      in psychopathic individuals and the relation of that tract to social emotional
      behavior modifications support these findings ( ). Although these results cannot
      resolve the direction of these connectivity effects, a previous study ( ) using
      this paradigm showed an effective connectivity modulation of emotional control
      on the connection from aPFC to amygdala. Also, animal studies ( ) suggest strong
      prefrontal inhibitory connections that control automatic amygdala responses.
      The absence of this aPFCamygdala coupling in psychopathic offenders suggests
      that in this group the aPFC has a reduced ability to inhibit amygdala-driven
      responses. This study used subtle emotional provocations, but stronger emotional
      events result in stronger amygdala responses, increasing the bias for automatic
      emotional behavior ( ). A lack of prefrontal control likely reduces the ability
      to inhibit these biases and lead to an increased expression of automatic emotional
      actions even when they are not beneficial ( ;  ). \n\nTestosterone administration
      studies also illustrated a decoupling between the prefrontal cortex and the
      amygdala, suggesting that testosterone reduces the communication between the
      PFC and amygdala ( ;  ;  ) and, within the AA task, reduces top-down control.
      The association between testosterone levels and enhanced social aggression and
      dominance seeking, and reduced impulse control in the general population ( ;  ;  )
      supports the relevance of testosterone in this process. Even amygdala responses
      to angry faces have recently been found to be enhanced after testosterone administration
      and in psychopathic individuals ( ;  ;  ). There is a clear association between
      testosterone and aggression after provocation, which has been related to reduced
      activity in the orbital frontal cortex, a region just ventral of the aPFC (
      ). Interestingly, psychopathic offenders with lower testosterone levels displayed
      a pattern similar to that in healthy control subjects, while the psychopathic
      individuals with high testosterone levels showed less aPFC activity and aPFCamygdala
      coupling. This could provide a potential vulnerability factor explaining the
      difference between the goal-directed successful psychopath and the unsuccessful
      psychopath with reduced impulse control ( ;  ). We hypothesize that especially
      psychopathic individuals with high testosterone levels fail to inhibit amygdala-driven
      action tendencies using the aPFC during the control of emotional behavior.\n
      \n\nEndogenous testosterone levels also modulated control-related activity in
      the supramarginal gyrus and caudate nucleus of the psychopathy group. The supramarginal
      gyrus was previously found to be involved during emotional control on the AA
      task in a healthy student sample ( ). Previous work indicated that it plays
      an important role in action organization ( ), and that psychopathic individuals
      show reduced supramarginal gyrus activity compared with control subjects when
      reasoning about other peoples emotional state ( ). The current findings, emphasizing
      the role of supramarginal gyrus during emotional control in psychopathic offenders
      with low testosterone levels, could indicate the facilitation of action preparation
      in trials with affect-incongruent stimulusresponse mapping. The caudate nucleus
      is important for incorporating predicted action outcome, when selecting the
      most beneficial behavioral goal ( ), and has previously found to be larger in
      psychopathy ( ). In light of these findings, our results suggest that psychopathic
      offenders with low endogenous testosterone levels, as opposed to those with
      high testosterone levels, have more interference of automatic action tendencies
      and outcomes associated with the facial emotions (e.g., approachhappy) that
      are opposite to the required actions during affect-incongruent trials ( ). \n\n\n###
      Interpretational issues \n  \nIndividuals with psychopathy have been suggested
      to have difficulty recognizing emotional expressions. However, this impairment
      seems quite specific to fear, rather than the emotional expressions used here
      (anger and happiness;  ;  ). Furthermore, the groups assessed in this study
      made comparable numbers of errors, suggesting that psychopathic offenders had
      no special difficulty in recognizing the clear emotional expressions used in
      this study. \n\nThis study used a relatively subtle manipulation to target the
      emotional control system. The rationale of this choice was to detect neural
      vulnerability markers without affecting behavioral performance. Psychopathic
      offenders performing a more salient behavioral version of the AA task showed
      reduced avoidance of angry faces ( ). In this study, angry faces evoked numerically
      similar behavioral effects ( ) and, additionally, aPFC effects (  post hoc   inspection
      of extracted parameters). Although these observations could be interpreted as
      a sign that psychopathic offenders have a tendency to approach angry faces,
      those observations were not statistically significant between groups [behavioral
      and aPFC group effects on angry faces:   p   > 0.2;   p   = 0.271;   z   = 2.54,
      on the angrycongruency effect in healthy control subjects masked implicitly
      by group (HC > PP)  angrycongruency interaction]. Future investigation is needed
      to directly test whether more provocative paradigms induce specific effects
      for angry faces. A previous study ( ) using this fMRI task in participants with
      genetic susceptibility for developing aggressive disorders, also found no group-specific
      behavioral effects. That study suggested that alterations of the aPFCamygdala
      pathway might reflect a vulnerability factor for psychopathologies. \n\nPreviously,
      endogenous testosterone modulated the aPFC and aPFCamygdala coupling in a sample
      of healthy students ( ). In that study, a different demographic group of healthy
      control subjects similarly showed a testosterone modulation of aPFCamygdala
      coupling, but no testosterone modulation of aPFC activity. This difference in
      the strength of testosterone-modulatory effects might be related to between-group
      differences in age (mean healthy control subjects, 41; mean students, 22;  ),
      educational level (staff of forensic psychiatric institute vs university students),
      or general anxiety [STAI trait, lower in healthy control subjects of the current
      study; mean (SD): 29 (4.4) and 34 (6.9), respectively;   t   = 2.605;   p   =
      0.014]. A limitation of this study is the modest sample size. Our focus to exclude
      moderating factors of comorbid disorders (except antisocial personality disorder)
      and recent drug use has the advantage that the sample is relatively homogeneous,
      but future studies using larger samples are needed for replication and to define
      subsamples. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nPsychopathic offenders showed reduced
      aPFC activity and aPFCamygdala connectivity during control of emotional actions,
      suggesting a decreased coordination of emotional information during rule-driven
      behavior. Moreover, endogenous testosterone modulated the involvement of these
      neural mechanisms. Psychopathic offenders with high testosterone levels showed
      less involvement of the aPFC, aPFCamygdala connectivity, supramarginal gyrus,
      and caudate nucleus, whereas psychopathic individuals with low testosterone
      levels recruited the aPFC in a fashion similar to that of healthy control subjects.
      These findings suggest that a lack of prefrontal control during emotional actions
      may explain enhanced impulsivity in psychopathic offenders during emotionally
      provoking situations. They outline a neuroendocrine model underlying impulsive
      emotional behavior in psychopathy and support the relevance of assessing a potential
      imbalance in testosterone function to guide treatment. It remains to be seen
      whether these neuroendocrine alterations of emotional control are also present
      in highly impulsive or antisocial individuals. \n\n\n \n\n Call the extractData

      to adopt the perspectives of others is fundamental to effective communication
      in social interactions. However, the neural correlates of allocentric thinking
      in communicative signaling remain unclear. We adapted a novel signaling task
      in which the signaler was given the target word and must choose a one-word signal
      to help the receiver guess the target. Behavioral results suggest that speakers
      can use allocentric thinking to choose signals that are salient from the perspective
      of the receiver rather than their own point of view. At the neural level, functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data reveal that the medial prefrontal cortex
      (mPFC), ventral striatum, and temporal-parietal junction are more activated
      when signalers engage in allocentric than egocentric thinking. Moreover, functional
      connectivity between the mPFC and ventral striatum predicted individuals perspective-taking
      ability during successful communication. These findings reveal that neural representations
      in the mPFC-striatum network support perspective-taking in complex social decision
      making, providing a new perspective on how the brain arbitrates between allocentric
      thinking and egocentric thinking in communication and social coordination.Previous

      successfully with another agent requires the ability to take that person''s
      perspective into account, so as to decide how to choose the most effective cues
      to send and how to correctly interpret signals received. The perspective-taking
      ability to know what others know (and, hence, what is mutually known) plays
      a fundamental role in message formulation and comprehension (Clark, 1985; Clark
      and Marshall, 1981; Glucksberg and Krauss, 1967; Krauss and Fussell, 1991; Ritter,
      1979; Rosenberg and Cohen, 1964). Grice (1975) proposed that conversational
      inferences are made possible by implicit agreements between speakers and listeners.
      In the Gricean cooperative principle, speakers utterances have to deliver the
      most relevant information on the topic of discussion in order to reduce the
      potential interference in the listeners inferential processes (Grice, 1957,
      1969; Grice, 1975). Namely, when speakers choose a particular word, they should
      adopt the perspective of their conversational partner to reduce referential
      ambiguity (Sperber and Wilson, 1995). Following Grice''s initial framework,
      a Rational Speech Act theory further posited that rational speakers should maximize
      the social utility of providing epistemic help to a listener (Goodman and Frank,
      2016). This is especially true when a particular event or object is being denoted
      during a conversation, a process called referential communication (Glucksberg
      et al., 1975; Krauss and Fussell, 1991; Wardlow, 2013).During referential communication,
      the signaler has a target meaning to convey and needs to send a signal that
      represents that meaning. The receiver, on the other hand, must infer the target
      meaning from the signal. A block to successful communication can happen as a
      signal that is salient/informative to the signaler is not necessarily so to
      the receiver, and vice versa (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). For example, the signaler
      may associate the target bank with cue money (a salient feature of the bank),
      but sending a signal representing money may not help the receiver to guess the
      word bank because bank is not a salient feature of money. Instead, to communicate
      adequately, the signaler may send a signal representing teller to help the receiver
      think of bank, even when the signaler may not strongly associate bank with teller
      (Nelson et al., 2004; Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). The knowledge of the patterns
      of salience between words provides a common ground between parties to communicate
      effectively without prior interactions with each other (Clark, 1996; Levinson,
      2006; Lewis, 1969; Nelson et al., 2004; Rosenberg and Cohen, 1964; Ryskin et
      al., 2015; Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). Effective communication requires individuals
      to use common ground information and to suppress the tendency to use private
      information (Bgels et al., 2015). Lewis (1969) posited a game-theoretic account
      of coordination indicating that salient aspects of world knowledge allow people
      to coordinate in the absence of convention. For example, the speakers might
      utter a word that is strongly connected with the referent to assist listeners
      in narrowing the possible referents that they will infer after hearing that
      word. Although several theories have proposed that the use of perspective-taking
      (e.g., inhibit egocentric perspective and adopt allocentric perspective) boots
      successful communication between two persons (e.g., Clark and Murphy, 1982;
      Grice, 1975; Levinson, 2006; Sperber and Wilson, 1995), empirical evidence regarding
      how people flexibly switch their perspectives (i.e., egocentric vs. allocentric)
      in word selection during communicative coordination is still lacking. Moreover,
      the neural basis of how speakers coordinate their communicative goal with others
      by taking the perspective of the person receiving the signal remains not well
      understood.A variety of referential communication tasks have been implemented
      to study the extent to which listeners are able to interpret the meaning of
      the signal by inferring others intention and belief (also known as mentalizing)
      (Apperly et al., 2010; Barr, 2008; Dumontheil et al., 2010a; Frank and Goodman,
      2012; Hanna et al., 2003; Keysar et al., 2000, 2003; Krauss and Glucksberg,
      1977; Sidera et al., 2018). A widely-used task in this area is the director
      task in which a director gives instructions to move objects around in a grid,
      some of which are only seen by the participants (listeners) but not by the director
      (Keysar et al., 2000). In order to be successful in selecting the target object,
      listeners need to correctly infer which objects are invisible from the speakers
      perspective and inhibit their own perspective accordingly. Researchers using
      this task showed that listeners were biased to their own egocentric perspective,
      i.e., participants looked longer at and reached more for an object which was
      only visible to themselves than the one observed by both parties (Apperly et
      al., 2010; Keysar, 2007, 2003; Lin et al., 2010). Neuroimaging studies with
      this task found activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and middle temporal
      gyri (MTG) when participants were required to take into account the perspective
      of the director (Dumontheil et al., 2010b; Hillebrandt et al., 2013). The mPFC
      is involved in the mentalizing network (Molenberghs et al., 2016; Schurz et
      al., 2014), while MTG is related to the recognition of faces (Acheson and Hagoort,
      2013; Singer et al., 2004). Another study also found that adolescents who were
      better in social perspective-taking usage during the director task had thinner
      cerebral cortex in the regions of middle frontal gyrus and the lateral parietal
      lobe (Tamnes et al., 2018), suggesting that frontal-parietal regions account
      for individual difference in perspective-taking. However, this line of research
      mainly focused on how individuals interpret others instructions in order to
      navigate the visual world. Whether and how individuals spontaneously choose
      signals that help listeners to better decode the signal correctly and effectively
      remains unclear.The mPFC and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) have been implicated
      repeatedly in mentalizing tasks which often involve the prediction of what the
      other person might think or feel in hypothetical situations using story vignettes
      and cartoons (Aichhorn et al., 2006; Castelli et al., 2000; Molenberghs et al.,
      2016; Schurz et al., 2014). These regions are also found to differentiate different
      aspects of mental states during cooperation versus competition in social games
      (Tsoi et al., 2016). In addition, neuroimaging studies using social interactive
      games that require iterative reasoning about people''s minds, such as the Beauty
      Contest game (Coricelli and Nagel, 2009), Patent Race game (Zhu et al., 2012),
      and Stag Hunt game (Yoshida et al., 2010), also found that the mPFC is involved
      in the inferential processes during strategic reasoning. The mPFC has been shown
      to dissociate between subjects with different levels (i.e., high versus low)
      of strategic reasoning in the Beauty Contest game, suggesting that mPFC implements
      more high-level strategic thinking when inferring other players thoughts (Coricelli
      and Nagel, 2009).In addition to these key mentalizing regions, the striatum
      is also implicated in strategic thinking in social contexts. The striatum has
      long been shown to encode reward prediction error signals in reinforcement learning
      tasks (Daniel and Pollmann, 2014; Garrison et al., 2013; Liljeholm and O''Doherty,
      2012), such as representing and resolving the mismatch between expected rewards
      and actual outcomes (Garrison et al., 2013; Pagnoni et al., 2002). In social
      tasks, striatal activation has also been observed in social learning and implicated
      in social prediction error and belief updating (Behrens et al., 2008; Hampton
      et al., 2008; Hertz et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2012). There
      is evidence that the frontostriatal circuit is a part of the neural architecture
      which facilitates executive functions, and is implicated in behavioral flexibility,
      adaptation to changes, and high-order decision-making (Alexander et al., 1986;
      Chudasama and Robbins, 2006; Gerraty et al., 2018; Seo et al., 2012). During
      social interactions, the simultaneous representations of one''s own and others
      intentions and beliefs may lead to social conflicts and thus require executive
      control to flexibly switch between appropriate perspectives. Therefore, such
      a process may engage the frontostriatal network to reduce social conflict and
      make decisions.Interestingly, the TPJ is not consistently shown in the contrast
      of high versus low levels of social strategic thinking (Coricelli and Nagel,
      2009; Nagel et al., 2018). One possibility is that the TPJ represents the cognitive
      aspect of the theory of mind (ToM; Apperly and Butterfill, 2009; Frith and Frith,
      2008; Premack and Woodruff, 1978), whereas mPFC registers the motivational aspect
      of ToM, which is more required in goal-directed interactive social situations
      (Koster-Hale et al., 2017; Molenberghs et al., 2016; Schurz et al., 2014). However,
      most of the previously mentioned social decision-making studies use mainly turn-based
      cooperative or competitive games in which participants need to consider others
      perspectives in order to make plans for the next step and therefore self and
      other perspective thinking are not necessarily in conflict as they occur sequentially.
      The experimental designs do not allow specific examination of the self-other
      viewpoint conflict resolution process, which is a critical component of strategic
      ToM.Here, to examine whether and how people solve the conflict between self
      and other perspectives spontaneously to promote successful communication, we
      adapted a novel signaling task in which the signaler was given a target word
      and needed to choose a response from a list of cue words to maximize the chance
      that the receiver guessed the target correctly (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). This
      online communicative task provides an ecologically valid measure of social decision-making.
      Research has shown that every two words have associative strengths (AS) in natural
      language understanding (Deese, 1959; Nelson et al., 2000). Moreover, the AS
      between a word pair is directional, that is, we can differentiate between a
      forward associative strength (target-to-cue; egocentrically salient) and backward
      associative strength (cue-to-target; allocentrically salient). In the current
      study, the salient patterns of the forward and backward AS between words were
      manipulated in each trial. Optimal performance in this task requires the signaler
      to choose from the perspective of the partner (i.e., responding relied on the
      backward AS) rather than from his/her own perspective (i.e., responding relied
      on the forward AS). Specifically, if a signaler is successful at taking other''s
      perspective, the signaler has to take into account the backward AS rather than
      the forward AS when communicating the meaning of the target word.To specify
      the brain activity related to this type of allocentric thinking most likely
      used in speakers goal-directed communicative behavior and differentiate it from
      instances where referential communication is not required, we introduced two
      other conditions that did not require communication. The first one was the matching
      condition in which both parties could see the target word and participants were
      asked to just match others responses by selecting the cue that others were likely
      to choose. No transmission of information was required to achieve the coordinative
      goal in this condition (so-called non-communicative coordination). The other
      one was the solo condition in which participants played the game solely and
      were asked to choose the response that was most salient to themselves. Of the
      three conditions (i.e., signaling, matching, solo), the signaling condition
      was the most challenging as it required perspective-taking. In the matching
      condition, the asymmetries of salience between cues would not necessarily hinder
      the success of coordination between two individuals, as we expected both to
      use the same salient point of view (forward AS for both players) to solve the
      problem (Chowdhury et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 1994). In contrast, the signaler
      and receiver in the signaling condition worked in opposite direction: the signaler
      had to select a cue to convey the meaning of a target word to the receiver and
      the receiver must infer the word from the cue. To do so successfully, the signaler
      must inhibit his/her salient perspective (from target-to-cue) and adopt the
      receiver''s perspective (from cue-to-target).Therefore, the current design allowed
      us to examine whether participants were able to adjust their perspectives as
      they transition from a non-communicative task in which the goal was to match
      the response with other people (the matching condition) to a communicative task
      in which the goal was to send a signal to help the listener to guess the target
      word (the signaling condition) given differing patterns of salience among words.
      The solo condition served as the non-social baseline as there was no need to
      think about others in this condition. By combining the novel signaling task
      with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined the neural
      basis of speakers egocentric thinking and allocentric thinking in word selection
      during different contexts, such as communicative coordination and non-communicative
      coordination. Our study also examined how both forward and backward associative
      strengths are encoded in the brain, which allowed us to assess the strength
      of egocentric and allocentric coding. We predicted that the mPFC and ventral
      striatum would be recruited in the allocentric thinking process when selecting
      a signal with a communicative goal. Given the anatomical connections between
      mPFC and striatum, and their shared role in social learning, we further predicted
      that the coupling between the two regions plays an important role in allocentric
      thinking.2. Methods2.1. ParticipantsThirty paid volunteers (12 women; mean age  SD,
      23.02  2.59 years) participated in the fMRI study. All participants were right-handed
      native speakers of English with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None of
      the participants suffered from psychiatric or neurological disorders or any
      hearing or language disorders. Participants were given Singapore dollar (S$$)20
      (approximately S$$1 = US$$0.73) for showing up and an extra monetary bonus based
      on performance in the tasks. All participants provided informed consent and
      completed the session based on the protocol that was approved by the National
      University of Singapore Institutional Review Board.2.2. Design and materialsOne
      hundred and eight sets of words were selected by a pretest (see the following
      session). According to the word association norms, there are two salient patterns
      of word association between words: the associative strength from a target word
      to a cue word is identified as forward AS, which is an egocentric point of view
      (salience from one''s own point of view, self-POV); whereas the associative
      strength from a cue word to a target word is recognized as backward AS, which
      is acknowledged as an allocentric point of view (salience from the other''s
      point of view, other-POV) (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). In each trial, one target
      word and three cue words were shown to participants. These three cue words had
      varied associative strengths with the target word. For each cue in the current
      study, we calculated its associative strengths with the target word from a large
      subject pool (see the pretest) that included direct forward strength (target-to-cue)
      and reverse backward strength (cue-to-target).It is worth noting that the direction
      of mutual salience between word pairs captured by the association norms may
      be asymmetric. For example, the top forward associate of day is night (target-to-cue:
      forward AS = 0.819), and the top backward associate of night is day (cue-to-target;
      AS = 0.686). Demonstrably, the patterns of salience between the target day and
      cue night are symmetrically high. In contrast, a cue week is not a salient feature
      of the target day. When people think of day, they are less likely to think of
      week. The target day does not strongly associate with the cue week (forward
      AS = 0.022) whereas the cue week strongly triggers the target day (backward
      AS = 0.473). Therefore, the patterns of salience between the target day and
      the cue week are asymmetrically high. These high and low examples were selected
      from Nelson et al. (2004).The asymmetries imply a difference in perspective:
      what is salient from the speaker''s point of view may not be salient from the
      listener''s point of view. To enable coordination between a speaker and a listener,
      people should have a conceptual understanding of the dissociation between self
      and others perspectives and successfully use the right perspective to guide
      their communication in different contexts. Therefore, we aimed to use the asymmetric
      saliences between the target word and cue word to capture speakers perspective-taking
      ability in a novel signaling task. Individuals should have common knowledge
      of the patterns of salience in word association and select a salient word to
      convey the meaning of a target to boost referential communication success. To
      do this, we filtered the one-word targets to ensure that each one could go along
      with at least two cues with opposite salient features. Specifically, the cues
      used in each trial included a word with high forward/low backward (HFLB) AS
      that was more salient from one''s own point of view, a word with low forward/high
      backward (LFHB) AS that was more salient from other''s point of view, and a
      word with low forward/low backward (LFLB) AS as an option to detect whether
      the participant was engaged in the task (see Fig. 1A). The mean forward AS and
      backward AS values for the three types of cues across all trials in each condition
      are listed in Table S1.Download : Download high-res image (307KB)Download :

      In each trial, participants were presented with a target word and three types
      of cues based on their association with the target word. Specifically, the cues
      used in each trial included a word with high forward/low backward (HFLB) AS
      that was salient from one''s own point of view, a word with low forward/high
      backward (LFHB) AS that was salient from other''s point of view, and a word
      with low forward/low backward (LFLB) AS as an option to detect whether the participant
      was engaged in the task. B, Task procedure and stimulus examples. Participants
      were asked to select one cue from a list tied to a specific target in three
      experimental conditions: (1) Signaling condition: help your partner guess the
      target; (2) Matching condition: match your response with your partner; (3) Solo
      condition: choose the first word that comes to mind. Participants were told
      to make a response within 10 s in each trial. Three trials of the same game
      type were presented consecutively as a mini block, followed by a long ITI (i.e.,
      a fixation crosshair) for 14 s, with the order of the mini blocks counterbalanced
      across participants.In the current study, we also focused on whether people
      were able to switch their perspective from self to other in communicative coordination
      rather than in non-communicative coordination or the solo condition. Therefore,
      participants were asked to select one cue from a list tied to a specific target
      in three experimental conditions: a non-coordinating condition (i.e. solo condition)
      as a non-strategic baseline and two types of coordinating conditions (communicative
      coordination and non-communicative coordination). We randomly divided all word
      sets into three experimental conditions, resulting in 36 unique word sets for
      each condition. The solo condition required participants to choose the first
      word that came to mind based on the list of three cue options. As for the non-communicative
      coordinating condition (i.e., matching condition), participants and their partners
      had to coordinate by independently selecting the same cue response given the
      target word in each trial. In the communicative coordinative condition (i.e.,
      signaling condition), participants were given the target word and had to select
      a cue to help their partner guess the target.2.3. AS evaluation (pretest)We
      used two word-association databases to construct the word-sets for our study.
      The first database was the University of South Florida Free Association Norms
      (USF; Nelson et al., 2004) from which data was taken for only normed pairs.
      This database contained a total of 63,619 cue-target pairs. The second database
      was the Small World of Words English (De Deyne et al., 2019) with 209,022 word-pairs
      and their association strengths.Both datasets consisted of target-cue pairs
      and their forward and backward association strengths. Forward association strength
      from target to cue was = P(cue|target), whereas the backward association strength
      from cue to target was = P(target|cue). We then sought to label target-cue pairs
      according to how high or low their forward/backward association strengths were.
      To define cutoffs for high and low, we looked at the distribution of all target-cue
      pair association strengths (separate distributions for forward and backward
      association strengths) and took certain limits as indicative of high or low
      association. For the USF word list, any association strengths below the 30th
      percentile were taken as low whereas those above the 70th percentile were taken
      as high. For the Small World of Words database, low was set at or below 10th
      percentile and high was set at or above 90th percentile. In this way, a target-cue
      pair was labeled according to its forward and backward association strengths.
      For example, a target-cue pair that had both high forward and high backward
      associations was labeled as HFHB, whereas another one with low forward and high
      backward strengths was labeled as LFHB. We then selected target words with three
      target-cue pair labels that fit the requirements of our study. Specifically,
      we chose target words that had HFLB, LFHB, and LFLB target-cue pairs available.
      When there were more than three target-cue pairs available, we used the one
      with the highest forward association value in the case of HFLB and the highest
      backward association value in the case of LFHB association. This gave us a set
      of 4 words: 1 target and 3 cues (i.e., three target-cue pairs in one word-set).
      From the word lists of the University of South Florida and Small World of Words,
      we retrieved a total of 251 sets and 833 sets respectively, giving us a total
      of 1084 word sets.We then recruited participants from Amazon''s Mechanical Turk
      service (MTurk; Buhrmester et al., 2011) to reevaluate the association ratings
      for all target-cue pairs (both forward and backward) that had been selected.
      This gave us an index of absolute association between words as opposed to the
      relative association (as was obtained from the word databases). Essentially,
      we presented MTurk workers with a target-cue pair and asked them to rate how
      much the first word brings to mind the second word, using a scale of 0-100 anchored
      at 0, 13, 25, 38, 50, 63, 75, 88 and 100. There was a total of 499 MTurk workers
      with mean age = 35.3 (SD = 9.83, 289 females) with each rating an average of
      150 target-cue pairs (on average, the same rating question was answered by 11
      workers). Participants rated all 3 target-cue pairs for any word-set in both
      forward and backward directions. The assignment of word-set and sequence of
      presentation of word-pairs were randomized across participants. We used data
      from raters who had at least an overall duration of 400 s in rating the entire
      list of 150 word-pairs (i.e. taking at least 2.6 s on average to rate each target-cue
      pair). We then took the average of evocation ratings for each target-cue pair
      to obtain an average evocation rating. Finally, the 1084 word-sets were ranked
      by the sum of AS differences for HFLB (participants average rating on High Forward
      minus Low Backward) and LFHB (High Backward minus Low Forward) cue words. The
      108 sets of words with the highest AS differences were selected.2.4. ProcedureOur
      experimental task is illustrated in Fig. 1B. Each participant underwent fMRI
      scanning while performing a total of 108 trials of the game. During scanning,
      the subject viewed a projection of a computer screen and gave a button response
      with the index, middle, and ring fingers of the right hand. Participants were
      told that the study involved three games: (1) choose the first word that comes
      to mind (for solo condition); (2) match your response with your partner (for
      matching condition); (3) help your partner guess the target (for signaling condition).
      Specifically, in the solo condition, participants were told that they had to
      choose the first word (out of the three options) that came to their mind given
      the target word for each trial and they would be given a fixed bonus (S$$2)
      regardless of their performance. In the matching condition, participants were
      told that in each trial they would be randomly paired with one other person
      who had taken part in this game with the same sets of words before them, and
      none of them knew whom they would be paired with. In addition, participants
      were instructed that the aim of the game was to coordinate or match their choices
      with that of their partners and their partners were also asked to do so. To
      increase the participants motivation to match their responses with their respective
      partners, participants were informed that both players would receive an extra
      20 cents for every choice that matched, and the maximum bonus across trials
      was S$$7.2. In the signaling condition, participants were asked to communicate
      effectively with their partners, and they were informed that there were two
      different roles in the game. Participants were assigned the role of signalers,
      while their partners who had taken part in the game with the same sets of words
      played as receivers. In each trial, the participant as a signaler had to choose
      a cue word from the list to convey the meaning of the target word to the receiver.
      In terms of communication success, the receiver must infer the meaning from
      the cue to decipher the target word. Participants were informed that both communicators
      would be rewarded 20 cents if the word they chose led their partner to successfully
      guess the given target word in a trial (previously) and the maximum bonus across
      trials was S$$7.2. Unbeknownst to the participants until the end of the study,
      in reality, there was no pairing of participants in the matching and signaling
      condition.Trials started with a fixation inter-trial interval (ITI) of 1.5-3.5
      s (jittered), after which a game appeared. On each trial, participants would
      see the instruction of the game on top of the screen and a target word was shown
      at the center of the screen along with three cues. When given the target word,
      participants were asked to select a cue from the list based on the instruction
      shown in each trial. In addition, participants were told that they should avoid
      choosing the word strictly from their personal life, and instead, they should
      make the choice based on shared world knowledge, the knowledge that most people
      would know. In order to give the participants enough time to think about their
      choices and conduct the experiment within the time constraint of the scanner,
      participants were told to make a response within 10 s, beyond which the stimuli
      would disappear without recording any response. The positions (left/middle/right)
      of the three types of cues (i.e. Word LFHB, Word HFLB, and Word LFLB) were counterbalanced
      across trials. In an effort to ensure that participants considered all possible
      responses to each question probed and reduce cross-trial habituation of the
      neural responses, the order of trials was pseudo-randomly determined for each
      participant: three trials of the same game type were presented consecutively
      as a mini block, followed by a long ITI (i.e., a fixation crosshair) for 14
      s. The mini blocks of the three game types were presented sequentially for each
      participant and the order of the presentation of the three game types was counterbalanced
      across participants. Additionally, the order of the word sets in every three
      trials of the same game type was randomized across participants.We did not provide
      any feedback to the participants in between trials. Before scanning, all participants
      received a written instruction about the experimental procedure and completed
      a practice session on a computer with another selected sets of words that were
      not used in the formal study to ensure comprehension of the game.2.5. Behavioral
      data analysisFor each experimental condition, task response was acquired and
      reaction time (RT) was measured. Prior to computing the mean percentage and
      RT of each choice, we omitted trials with reaction time less than 400 ms, which
      were rare. To examine perspective-taking in each condition, we focused on the
      difference between the self-POV option and the other-POV option by taking the
      proportion of participants choosing the Word HFLB to subtract the proportion
      of choosing the Word LFHB. We conducted a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA to
      analyze the self-other perspective differences for the three conditions, using
      the condition (i.e. solo, matching, and signaling) as the within-subject variable,
      and the proportion of individual''s choice difference between Word HFLB and
      Word LFHB as a dependent variable. In addition, a two-way repeated-measures
      ANOVA was conducted using the condition (solo, matching, and signaling) and
      the word perspective (Word HFLB and Word LFHB) as independent factors and the
      mean RT to make the choice as the dependent variable. In these analyses, the
      Greenhouse-Geisser corrected degrees of freedom for non-sphericity was applied
      where appropriate. Multiple comparisons were controlled using the Bonferroni
      correction.We further investigated the relationship between the coordinative
      effect across different conditions. In the solo and matching condition, the
      coordinative effect was calculated using the frequency of choosing the Word
      HFLB minus the frequency of choosing the Word LFHB; while in the signaling condition,
      the coordinative effect was identified in an opposite way using the frequency
      of choosing the Word LFHB minus the frequency of choosing the Word HFLB. Because
      the normality assumption is violated (as revealed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests),
      Spearman rank-order correlation analysis was used. To show the robustness of
      the correlation results, outliers that were either 1.5 times the interquartile
      range or more above the third quartile or 1.5 times the interquartile range
      or more below the first quartile of the data in each condition were removed.
      This resulted in one participant''s data being removed.Because responses to
      our novel signaling task were presumed to be based on forward and backward salience,
      we further tested whether individuals responses could be predicted by the associative
      strengths between the target words and the cue words. For example, in the signaling
      condition, high backward AS may be positively correlated with the proportion
      of participants choosing Word LFHB across the trials. Hence, the relationship
      between the associative strength and participants choice was analyzed with generalized
      linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) with the LME4 package in R statistical software
      (version 3.6.1; R Core Team, 2019). Binomial mixed-effects regressions with
      the target word treated as a random intercept were performed separately for
      each type of games as in the previous study (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). Using
      mixed-effects models, we were able to take into account the variability in word
      items (Baayen et al., 2008; Barr et al., 2013; Bates et al., 2015). See supplementary
      for another regression model that included subjects and word items as the random
      intercepts. All data (as well as the R scripts for GLMM analyses) are available
      at the Open Science Framework (OSF) https://osf.io/w6khb.2.6. fMRI data acquisitionImaging
      was performed on a Siemens PRISMA 3T MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany)
      with a 32-channel head coil at the Clinical Imaging Research Centre of the National
      University of Singapore. Functional images were collected using a 2-dimensional
      multiband single-shot T2*-weighted, echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (78 slices,
      2 mm-thickness; TR = 1000 ms; TE = 31.40 ms; flip angle = 60; FOV = 220 mm;
      matrix size = 88  88; voxel size: 2.5  2.5  2.0 mm3) with a multi-band acceleration
      factor of 6 covering the entire brain in the oblique axial plane. A high resolution
      (1.0  1.0  1.0 mm3) T1-weighted MPRAGE anatomical image (TR = 2300 ms; TE =
      2.22 ms; flip angle = 8; 1 mm-thickness) was acquired for registration and normalization
      of functional data to the standard brain. The total acquisition time for MPRAGE
      is 4 min and 52 s. Head padding was used for each subject to minimize head motion,
      and headphones and earplugs were used to dampen the scanner noise.2.7. fMRI
      data analysisQuality control was done with the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC,
      version 0.15.2) (Esteban et al., 2017). The signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., snr)
      in our data ranged from 4.30 to 5.40. Mean framewise displacement (FD) and temporal
      derivative of the voxel time course variance (DVARS) were used as the main quality
      control measures for the functional imaging data (Power et al., 2012). FD is
      a data quality index expressing instantaneous head-motion based on change in
      head position across frames. DVARS is another quality index that estimates the
      rate of change of BOLD signal across the whole brain at each frame. Participants
      were excluded if the mean FD value for one run exceeded 0.3 mm (fd_mean from
      MRIQC), or if the DVARS was more than 6% BOLD signal change (DVARS_nstd from
      MRIQC of over 60). No participants were excluded based on this standard.We preprocessed
      and analyzed fMRI data using SPM12 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). The first eight
      volumes were discarded due to unsteady magnetization. To correct for head-motion,
      the remaining volumes were realigned spatially to the first non-discarded volume.
      Images were then re-sliced to obtain a mean image. The anatomical image was
      then co-registered to the mean functional image after motion correction and
      segmentation, generating parameters for normalization. All volumes were subsequently
      normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and resampled
      to 2  2  2 mm3 isotropic voxel. The normalized functional images were then spatially
      smoothed with Gaussian kernel with 8 mm FWHM. Lastly, we applied a high-pass
      temporal filter with a cutoff of 128 s to remove low-frequency drifts.After
      preprocessing, statistical analysis of the event-related fMRI signals was performed
      for each participant using the general linear model (GLM) (Friston et al., 1994).
      In our task, each trial consisted of one event aligned to the presentation of
      the three cue options with the target word. To dissociate the fMRI activity
      for different trials, regressors were constructed by convolving the canonical
      hemodynamic response function (HRF) at the time of response with zero duration.
      This is the juncture whereby participants made their choices. The first-level
      GLM design matrix was made up of six regressors of interest: the combinations
      of three game types (solo, matching, and signaling conditions) and two participants
      choices (choosing Word LFHB and choosing Word HFLB). As participants made the
      choices based on their own beliefs, the number of trials was a bit different
      across six regressors (mean trial  SD for Matching HFLB: 19  4; Matching LFHB:
      15  5; Signaling HFLB: 15  6; Signaling LFHB: 19  6; Solo HFLB: 21  4; Solo
      LFHB: 13  4). As the word choice reflected the perspective that participants
      were taking (self-POV or other-POV), the current model allowed us to investigate:
      the neural differences between the other-POV and self-POV choice within each
      condition (i.e. Signaling LFHB vs. Signaling HFLB, Matching LFHB vs. Matching
      HFLB and Solo LFHB vs. Solo HFLB). All regressors were further modulated by
      a parametric modulator containing the difference between the forward and backward
      associative strengths of the chosen option. The aim of testing the modulator
      effect was to investigate whether and how the brain responded to the degree
      of salience between forward and backward AS across different situations in a
      quantitative way. In addition, the six scan-to-scan motion parameters produced
      during realignment were included as additional regressors in the GLM to account
      for residual motion effects. The contrasts of the first-level analysis were
      entered into a one-sample t-test for the second-level group analysis conducted
      with a random effect statistical model.To assess the functional connectivity
      among regions in the signaling conditions, we conducted generalized psychophysiological
      interaction (gPPI) analyses with a gPPI toolbox (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/gppi)
      to examine the covariation between the neural activities in two brain areas
      (McLaren et al., 2012). We were particularly interested in the brain areas that
      showed variation of functional connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex
      during the signaling condition. The seed regions were created using a 6-mm diameter
      sphere at the left (peak coordinate MNI: x, y, z = -8, 44, -2) and right of
      mPFC (peak coordinate MNI: x, y, z = 2, 42, 8) as identified in the whole-brain
      analysis while comparing the word LFHB with the word HFLB in the signaling condition.
      For completeness, we also ran two additional gPPI analyses with the contrasts
      of Word LFHB vs. Word HFLB in the matching condition and solo condition.At the
      first-level analysis, we first extracted the de-convolved time series within
      the seed region as the physiological regressor. We then define all regressors
      in the designed GLM as the psychological regressors. These two terms were multiplied
      as the PPI regressors. All these regressors were convolved with the canonical
      hemodynamic response function to model the BOLD signal. In addition, six head-motion
      parameters were included as covariates to account for residual motion effects.
      We further carried out whole-brain regression analyses between gPPI connectivity
      estimates and the mean coordinative effect based on participants choice. The
      contrasts between the PPI regressors (e.g., word LFHB vs. word HFLB in the signaling
      condition) for each participant were used at the second-level analysis with
      their corresponding behavioral index as a covariate (e.g., choosing the Word
      LFHB - choosing the Word HFLB in the signaling condition).To correct for multiple
      comparisons, results were obtained at a voxel-level height threshold of p <
      0.005 and survived after cluster-level family-wise error correction (FWE) at
      p < 0.05. In addition, small volume correction (SVC) with FWE corrected p-value
      (p < 0.05) was used on a priori regions of interest previously implicated in
      mentalizing and interpersonal strategic thinking: medial prefrontal cortex (MNI,
      x, y, z =  3, 51, -9 mm) (Coricelli and Nagel, 2009), temporo-parietal junction
      (x, y, z =  52, -30, 10 mm) (Schurz et al., 2014), ventral striatum (x, y, z
      =  10, 10, -6 mm) (Yoshida et al., 2010), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (x,
      y, z =  6, 30, 42 mm) (Nagel et al., 2018). Spherical search space with 8 mm
      radius was defined surrounding the independently defined coordinates reported
      above. For display purposes, all contrast images are depicted at p < 0.005,
      uncorrected. All results are available on Neurovault (Gorgolewski et al., 2015);
      see https://identifiers.org/neurovault.collection:9096.3. Results3.1. Behavioral
      resultsAlthough participants were free to make their own decisions by choosing
      any options provided, the Word LFLB was rarely chosen. The proportions of participants
      choosing the Word LFLB in three conditions were low, as would be expected (mean  SD,
      Solo: 0.056  0.043; Matching: 0.057  0.041; Signaling: 0.038  0.038), providing
      evidence that participants were able to identify the strongly associated cues
      with the target word across trials and continued to be engaged in the tasks
      throughout the experiment.Our first analysis on the proportion of participants
      choosing the Word HFLB (self-POV) minus the proportion of participants choosing
      the Word LFHB (other-POV) revealed a significant main effect (F(2, 58) = 18.234,
      p < 0.001, p2= 0.385; Fig. 2A) for the condition. Our post-hoc analysis found
      that the mean choice difference in the signaling condition (mean = -0.105, 95%
      CI [-0.193, -0.018]) was significantly lower than that in the matching condition
      (mean = 0.092, 95% CI [0.024, 0.160], p = 0.001) and the solo condition (mean
      = 0.205, 95% CI [0.136, 0.0.275], p < 0.001), with these latter conditions having
      no significant difference between them (p = 0.101). These results suggest that
      participants did use the allocentric perspective to convey the message in the
      signaling condition. Our findings support the idea that people are able to differentiate
      the salient patterns between egocentric and allocentric perspective in different
      word pairs and flexibly switch the perspective from self to other to select
      the optimal signal.Download : Download high-res image (279KB)Download : Download

      between the self-POV option and the other-POV option (the proportion of choosing
      the Word HFLB minus the proportion of choosing the Word LFHB) as a function
      of condition (solo, matching, and signaling). B, Mean reaction time as a function
      of condition (solo, matching, and signaling) and word perspective (choosing
      Word LFHB and choosing Word HFLB). The violin plots indicate the density of
      the sample distribution across the y-values. Error bars represent within-subject
      95% CIs.A two-way repeated measures ANOVA on the mean reaction time found no
      significant two-way interaction effect between the condition and the word perspective
      (F(2, 58) = 0.081, p = 0.922, p2 = 0.003, Fig. 2B), and no significant main
      effect for the word perspective (F(1, 29) = 1.393, p = 0.248, p2 = 0.046). However,
      a significant main effect for the condition (F(1.477, 42.843) = 30.055, p <
      0.001, p2 = 0.509) was observed. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the RT in the
      signaling condition (mean = 4.741, 95% CI [4.593, 4.889]) was longer than that
      in the matching condition (mean = 4.465, 95% CI [4.369, 4.561], p = 0.007) and
      in the solo condition (mean = 4.067, 95% CI [3.928, 4.207], p < 0.001). In addition,
      participants decision-making was observably slower in the matching condition
      than the solo condition (p < 0.001). The slower responses in the signaling condition
      indicated that coordination in a communicative context involves more complex
      inferential processing in general.Additionally, correlation tests were conducted
      to examine the relationships of the coordinative effect among the three conditions.
      Spearman''s correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between
      the coordinative effects in the matching condition (HFLB - LFHB) and the signaling
      condition (LFHB - HFLB) (rs = -0.422, p = 0.023, n = 29), suggesting that taking
      the perspectives from one''s point of view in a non-communicative task may impede
      an individual from switching to others point of view in a communicative task.
      We also found that the coordinative effect in the solo condition was marginally
      correlated with that in the matching condition (rs = 0.357, p = 0.058, n = 29)
      but not correlated with that in the signaling condition (rs = -0.313, p = 0.098,
      n = 29).To statistically examine whether and how the proportion of participants
      choosing each cue was predicted by the salient patterns of egocentric and/or
      allocentric perspective in different situations, binomial mixed-effects regressions
      were performed separately for each type of games (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). For
      each condition, the model included the forward and backward AS as fixed effects
      and the count of participants choosing each type of cues as the dependent variable.
      The two continuous independent variables were centered on zero and scaled as
      the model required. We included a random intercept for target word. In a first
      step, we fitted a null model in which we only put the random effect of the target
      word. In the second step, the fixed effects (forward and backward AS of the
      chosen word) were added to the models. In a final step, the interactions between
      the fixed effects were added to a new model. The Akaike information criterion
      (AIC) was used to compare the models, with and without interaction terms, between
      the fixed effects. Specifically, the model with lower AIC was considered to
      have a better model fit. The results showed that models with interaction terms
      were better than models without interaction terms for all models of three game
      types (model fit for the matching condition: AIC = 1237, 2(1) = 33.731, p <
      0.001; solo condition: AIC = 1027, 2(1) = 4.388, p = 0.036; signaling condition:
      AIC = 944.29, 2(1) = 10.455, p = 0.001).Therefore, we focused on the models
      with interaction terms between forward and backward AS for each condition. In
      the signaling condition, parameter estimates indicated that there were significant
      main effects for forward AS ( = 0.646, SE = 0.058, z = 11.124, p < 0.001) and
      backward AS ( = 0.854, SE = 0.061, z = 13.983, p < 0.001). Through the comparison
      of the model parameters, it showed that the main effect of forward AS was smaller
      than that of backward AS in the signaling condition. Moreover, the two-way interaction
      between forward and backward AS significantly affected participants choice (
      = -0.214, SE = 0.066, z = -3.225, p = 0.001). This finding suggests that backward
      AS had larger effect on participants choice when forward AS was low (see Fig.
      3A). For the matching condition, we found significant main effects for forward
      AS ( = 0.816, SE = 0.064, z = 12.795, p < 0.001) and backward AS ( = 0.649,
      SE = 0.072, z = 9.027, p < 0.001), and also found a significant interaction
      effect ( = -0.416, SE = 0.072, z = -5.752, p < 0.001), suggesting that the backward
      AS had much weaker effect when forward AS was high (see Fig. 3B). For the solo
      condition, we found significant main effects for forward AS ( = 1.110, SE =

      p < 0.001), and a significant interaction effect ( = -0.166, SE = 0.081, z =
      -2.048, p = 0.041) was also observed, suggesting that backward AS only showed
      weak effect when forward AS was low (see Fig. 3C). A comparison of the model
      parameters showed that the main effect of forward AS was larger than that of
      backward AS in the matching condition and solo condition, suggesting that choices
      in these two conditions were mainly influenced by forward AS.Download : Download

      cue, including an interaction between backward and forward associative strengths
      (AS, values were rescaled). A, In the signaling condition, there was a strong
      backward AS effect on participants choices and the backward AS effect was more
      dominant when forward AS was low. B, In the matching condition, there was a
      strong forward AS effect on participants choices, and the backward AS only had
      a positive effect when forward AS was low. C, In the solo condition, there was
      a strong forward AS effect on participants choices, and the modulation effect
      of the backward AS in this condition was weaker than that in the matching condition
      (by comparing the middle and right panels).3.2. fMRI resultsTable 1 lists all
      significant peak activations for the comparisons between Word LFHB and Word
      HFLB in each condition. For the signaling condition, we compared word LFHB with
      word HFLB and found activity in the bilateral mPFC, right ventral striatum,
      right TPJ, superior frontal gyrus (SFG), left precuneus, and left inferior frontal
      gyrus (IFG) (Fig. 4A). No significant activation was found for the reverse contrast.
      Our parametric analysis further showed that activity in the left ventral striatum
      in response to the Word LFHB was positively correlated with the differences
      between the forward and backward associative strengths during decision making
      (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the ventral striatum may encode the interference
      from the salience feature of forward association strength. In the matching condition,
      Word LFHB versus Word HFLB only activated the left ventral striatum (Fig. 4D).
      No significant activation was found for the reverse contrast. The parametric
      analysis showed that activity in the mPFC in response to the decision of choosing
      Word HFLB was significantly correlated with the differences between the forward
      and backward associative strengths (Fig. 5B). For the solo condition, no supra-threshold
      clusters were found for the contrast of Word LFHB versus Word HFLB or Word HFLB
      versus Word LFHB (Fig. 4E). The parametric analysis in the solo condition found
      increased activity in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) as the
      differences between the forward and backward associative strengths increased
      when choosing Word HFLB (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the interaction contrast between
      the signaling condition and the solo condition [Signaling (LFHB > HFLB) vs.
      Solo (LFHB > HFLB)] revealed brain activity in the right supramarginal gyrus,
      bilateral TPJ, bilateral mPFC, and right ventral striatum (Fig. 4B), suggesting
      that these regions really tap into allocentric thinking in the signaling context.Table

      with the individual differences in the allocentric thinking performance (the

      Brain activations of the parametric analysis. A, In the signaling condition,
      the left ventral striatum encoded the differences between forward AS and backward
      AS when choosing Word LFHB. B, In the matching condition, the mPFC encoded the
      differences between forward AS and backward AS when choosing Word HFLB. C, In
      the solo condition, the dmPFC encoded the differences between forward AS and

      the bilateral mPFC that activated in the signaling condition as seeds further
      showed that the coupling between mPFC and ventral striatum significantly predicted
      individual differences in communication success (i.e., choosing the Word LFHB
      minus choosing the Word HFLB) during decision-making in the signaling condition
      (Fig. 4C, left panel). The regions with significant activation in high order
      PPI analyses are listed in Table 2. In other words, participants who were more
      capable of switching their viewpoint from self to other in communication showed
      higher levels of coupling between the mPFC and ventral striatum (Fig. 4C, right
      panel). This coactivation between mPFC and ventral striatum was not found in
      the non-communicative conditions, i.e., matching and solo conditions.Table 2.

      FWE after small volume correction.4. DiscussionUsing a novel signaling task
      combined with fMRI, we examined the neural correlates of allocentric thinking
      during communication. We found that the mPFC, ventral striatum, and TPJ were
      more engaged when participants made allocentric choices in a communicative context.
      The interference from forward AS was associated with activity in the ventral
      striatum. Moreover, the neural coupling between mPFC and ventral striatum predicted
      individual differences in choosing the allocentric choices to promote communication
      success. These patterns were not found in the control conditions that do not
      require communicative signaling. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
      mPFC and striatum in allocentric thinking in social contexts, going beyond their
      putative role in coding the subjective value of reward and reward prediction
      error.In the signaling condition, signalers need to choose the most effective
      cue to help listeners get the message to be sent. It is crucial for the signaler
      to take the perspective of the person receiving the signal and consider the
      cue that is likely to be inferred correctly by the receiver. Our behavioral
      data showed that participants were more likely to choose LFHB words than HFLB
      words in the signaling condition but not in the other two conditions, suggesting
      that they do have the ability to think from receivers point of view if needed.
      In addition, the reaction times of making decisions were slower in the signaling
      condition compared with the other two conditions, suggesting that signaling
      to others is generally more taxing than non-communicative coordination with
      others. Our regression model further showed that participants were indeed guided,
      to some degree, by backward AS when making choices in the signaling condition.Success
      in communication relies on speakers choosing utterances that can be used by
      listeners to infer the intended information. Indeed, previous studies have shown
      that listeners spontaneously seek to incorporate information about the speaker''s
      mental state during communication. In a targeted language game in which participants
      had a joint goal requiring them to exchange information, eye-tracking data showed
      that addressees used the distinction between shared and private information
      as they interpreted language on-line (Brown-Schmidt et al., 2008; Heller et
      al., 2008). In interactive conversations, listeners represent information about
      the perspective of the speaker and use this information to guide the processing
      of the speaker''s utterances (Frank and Goodman, 2012; Franke and Degen, 2016).
      Taken together, these findings corroborate that successful communication is
      contingent on mutual strategic reasoning-from both the speaker sending relevant
      information, and the listener extracting it.Importantly, our study found enhanced
      activity in the mPFC, ventral striatum, and TPJ when participants chose LFHB
      words over HFLB words in the singling condition. The TPJ has been found in mentalizing
      tasks using hypothetical scenarios. It has been proposed that TPJ represents
      an epistemic or cognitive aspect of mentalization, whereas mPFC encodes the
      motivational component of ToM (Jenkins and Mitchell, 2010; Koster-Hale et al.,
      2017). The TPJ activity in our study may reflect individuals understanding of
      others knowledge. Both the mPFC and ventral striatum are implicated in both
      reward-based learning and social learning (Garrison et al., 2013). It has been
      suggested that the mPFC serves as a module that integrates social information
      and represents intentionality at a more abstract cognitive level (Sui and Gu,
      2017; Van Overwalle, 2009). Previous studies have shown that mPFC represents
      the similarity between self and others (Mobbs et al., 2015; Mobbs et al., 2009).
      Dumontheil et al. (2010a, 2010b) using the director task also found parts of
      the mentalizing network, including the mPFC and temporal pole, was activated
      when individuals followed the director''s instructions to move objects. A neuroimaging
      meta-analysis further confirmed that mPFC is closely linked to perspective-taking
      (D''Argembeau et al., 2007; Denny et al., 2012). The enhanced activity in mPFC
      when participants engage in allocentric thinking may indicate switching from
      self-centered to other-centered perspectives. Spatial and functional gradience
      for mentalizing has been shown in mPFC (Denny et al., 2012). It has been demonstrated
      that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is more associated with self-processing
      (Hu et al., 2016; Sui and Humphreys, 2015), while the dorsomedial prefrontal
      is more associated with other-related processing, such as mentalizing/theory
      of mind (Hu et al., 2016; Sul et al., 2015). Both ventral and dorsal mPFC were
      activated in response to allocentric thinking in our signaling condition. Our
      findings may suggest that taking other-oriented perspectives involves both the
      self-referential process and mentalizing processes. The functional segregation
      and integration of mPFC subregions in communicative contexts may be an interesting
      topic for future studies. The ventral striatum plays a crucial role in goal-directed
      learning (Guo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2020; O''Doherty et al., 2004) as
      well as reward processing (Yaple et al., 2020). It is important to note that
      activity in the ventral striatum was correlated with the degree of interference
      induced by the conflict between forward and backward associative strengths.
      Our findings may suggest that the ventral striatum encodes the conflict between
      allocentric and egocentric thinking and subsequently guides signaling behaviors.
      In addition, even without an exogenous reward in the current study, successfully
      detecting and solving such a viewpoint conflict to achieve the communicative
      goal might be itself the reward. Indeed, the Rational Speech Act theory considers
      communication as a goal-directed activity and the speaker derives the social
      utility of helping the listener to achieve communicative goals (Goodman and
      Frank, 2016). The ventral striatum may be engaged in detecting the need for
      such perspective-changing to enable goal achievement.Moreover, we found that
      the functional connectivity between mPFC and ventral striatum predicted individual
      differences in the degree of allocentric thinking, indexing by the difference
      between the percentage of participants choosing Word LFHB and choosing Word
      HFLB in the signaling condition. Across a wide range of psychological tasks,
      a meta-analytic coactivation analysis showed mPFC coactivation with subcortical
      regions, especially the ventral striatum (de la Vega et al., 2016). Altered
      ventral striatal-medial prefrontal cortex connectivity has been found in individuals
      with social problems (Fareri et al., 2017), stress-related psychopathology (Hanson
      et al., 2018), and depression (Admon and Pizzagalli, 2015), suggesting that
      the coupling between these two regions play a pivotal role in supporting smooth
      social interactions. The strength of functional connectivity between the striatum
      and mPFC has also been associated with learning speed in a probabilistic environment
      (van den Bos et al., 2012). Decreased frontostriatal functional connectivity
      was associated with reduced cognitive flexibility (Vaghi et al., 2017). Frontostriatal
      hyperconnectivity in high performing individuals in a signaling task might represent
      their ability to inhibit the innate tendency to choose self-related words and
      make goal-directed choices. Our study delineates how self-other viewpoint conflicts
      are encoded in the brain and provides some preliminary biological evidence for
      the inferential processing between self and other in pragmatic reasoning.Although
      not the focus of our study, we also found that the ventral striatum was activated
      when participants chose the low forward and high backward words in the matching
      task. Activity in the mPFC was correlated with the difference between forward
      AS and backward AS when choosing Word HFLB. These findings suggest that mPFC
      and striatum may also play an important role in pure coordination. Our previous
      study found that mPFC is engaged in perspective-taking when participants managed
      to reach focal points during pure coordination (Chowdhury et al., 2020). In
      the context of pure coordination in which participants were provided with symmetry
      information, individuals should be guided by forward AS alone and there is no
      obvious conflict arising from the differences between forward and backward AS.
      Thus, such coordination does not require the inhibition of automatic egocentric
      thinking driven by forward AS. Nevertheless, perspective-taking is needed for
      successful coordination even though one''s own perspective and others perspective
      may just be the same in most cases.In summary, although mentalizing has been
      linked to several brain regions, our study points out the key role of the mPFC-striatum
      network in supporting spontaneous allocentric thinking in successful communication.
      Our findings contribute to the deconstruction and specification of the mentalizing
      processes in social communication and shed light on how the brain implements
      viewpoint conflict resolution to achieve communicative signaling goals. Future
      studies may further examine whether modulating activity in this frontostriatal
      network could boost or hinder performance in communicative tasks.Data and code

      Introduction \n  \nWith more than 25% of high school seniors reporting recent
      use and 6.5% of 12th graders being daily users ( ), marijuana (MJ) is the most
      frequently used illicit substance among adolescents. Across all age groups over
      70% of new drug initiates start with using MJ at an average age of 18 years
      ( ). Indeed, the scope of MJ use prevalence is of great public interest, as
      MJ use in early adolescence is associated with increased risk of greater substance
      use, legal problems, disrupting education, injuries/medical problems, developing
      psychopathology, cognitive changes and chronic psychosocial struggles ( ,  ,  ,  ).
      Taken together, rates of MJ use are suggestive of an epidemic based in adolescence,
      which is concerning not just due to societal cost, but also due to the potential
      to offset sensitive brain development during this period. \n\nDespite its prevalence,
      the impact of MJ use on adolescent brain development is not fully known. Important
      neuromaturational processes during adolescence through young adulthood are believed
      to bring about improved higher-order cognition by refining neural systems locally
      and globally through white and gray matter development ( ,  ,  ). In general,
      gray matter reductions and cortical thinning coincide with increased white matter
      volume and organization through adolescence and young adulthood, suggestive
      of synaptic pruning and axonal myelination ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The endogenous cannabinoid
      (CB) system is also immature during adolescence ( ,  ). In an animal model (
      ) imaged CB1 receptor binding using PET and found relatively lower activation
      of CB1 receptors in adolescent rats compared to adult rats in brain areas including
      those in the frontal cortex, temporal lobe (hippocampus and amygdala) and sub-cortical
      regions including striatal regions, thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus.
      Thus, adolescence represents a developmental period with vulnerability to structural
      and functional changes due to exogenous MJ exposure. \n\nAdolescent MJ use has
      the potential to cause structural and functional changes in the brain by altering
      cannabinoid signaling. One possible mechanism would be blunt neurotoxic influence.
      For example, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component
      in MJ that binds CB1 receptors, is reported to cause cell shrinkage and damage
      DNA strands in THC-treated neuron cultures ( ). This may be the mechanism by
      which smaller volumes have been observed in individuals exposed to cannabis
      during adolescence ( ). However, it is more likely that MJ exerts its influence
      on brain development indirectly. The cannabinoid system plays a role in modulating
      other neurotransmitters, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate
      and monoamines ( ). Specifically, activation of CB1 receptors is associated
      with down-regulating inhibitory GABAergic transmission in cortical interneurons
      during adolescence ( ,  ). In addition, CB signaling inhibits microglia function
      ( ). These two points are important because cortical pruning processes involve
      glial-mediated synaptic elimination and altering the excitatory/inhibitory balance
      is liable to disrupt the selective tagging and preserving synapses ( ). The
      impact of this indirect influence on the developing brain may be in the observations
      of abnormal connectivity in those who began MJ use in adolescence ( ). Evidence
      from human neuroimaging studies lends greater support to MJ-related disruptions
      to brain development. \n\nStructural neuroimaging studies have indicated that
      volumes of several brain areas are smaller in heavy adult MJ users especially
      in areas enriched with cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors, such as medial temporal
      lobe, and prefrontal cortex ( ). Studies of adult chronic MJ users note brain
      volume reductions in temporal lobe, insula, and prefrontal cortex, amygdala
      and hippocampus ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Among different characteristics of MJ involvement
      (e.g., dependence symptoms, use frequency, consumption), the age of initial
      MJ use is a robust factor that has been associated with smaller brain volumes
      in users. For example,   observed left parahippocampal gyrus and right temporal
      pole structural differences in 25 regular MJ users compared to 22 occasional
      users, however, even the occasional users who began smoking MJ during adolescence
      (before age 18) demonstrated similar brain changes as the regular users. Our
      group has also found links with early MJ use onset ( ) and structural connectivity
      with orbitofrontal cortex in a cohort of daily MJ users, suggesting complex
      neuroadaptive processes related to MJ use in the context of adolescent brain
      development ( ). These findings underscore the potential for significant heterogeneity
      in brain changes among adult MJ users, especially those who began using MJ during
      neurodevelopment. \n\nStudies comparing early adolescent MJ use to users initiating
      MJ use in later adolescence provide further evidence for the potential of MJ
      to cause enduring change. The few studies that have directly investigated the
      timing of the effects of MJ during adolescence have noted divergent neurodevelopment
      effects. For example, in an fMRI study by Gruber and colleagues, functional
      and behavioral differences during an interference task were reported between
      early (before age 16) and late (after age 16) MJ users ( ) ( ). The same group
      also reported decreased white matter integrity in early onset vs. late onset
      MJ users (mean age 14.46 vs. 17.93) ( ). Similar differential effects have also
      been noted in parietal lobe activation between early and late adolescent binge
      drinkers during a spatial working memory task ( ). These studies highlight the
      importance of clarifying the differential neural effects of early- and late-adolescent
      onset use. \n\nTo that end, in the current study, we compared daily MJ users
      who were early onset users (<16 years old) versus late onset users (16 years
      old) on measures of cortical morphology that are sensitive to developmental
      changes. We aimed to characterize both the effect of early onset status on cortical
      morphology as well as assess for morphological patterns linked to the continued
      use of MJ after early and late adolescent MJ initiation. We expected early onset
      users to show a morphological pattern consistent with disruption of early adolescent
      brain development (e.g., increased cortical thickness, greater gray/white definition
      of the cortical ribbon via disruptions to adolescent pruning processes) that
      may be more consistent with indirect impact of MJ of brain development. While
      gray matter decline has been shown to be associated with marijuana use, particularly
      in areas rich in CB1 receptors, increased cortical thickness and greater gray/white
      definition in the cortical ribbon point to potential disruption in neurodevelopment
      (i.e. synaptic pruning) that may result from MJ use at key developmental stages
      (i.e. earlier as opposed to later in adolescent neuronal development). Such
      disruptions may extend to gyrification as well. While this process begins in
      utero, there is evidence that gyrification is ongoing into adolescence ( ,  ,  )
      and may also display aberrant developmental patterns in the presence of MJ use.
      \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis study was approved by the University of Texas at
      Dallas (UTD) and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) Institutional
      Review Boards. All participants were recruited from the Dallas-Ft.Worth metro
      area via flyers and advertisements. Following informed consent, MJ users completed
      two sessions  a baseline appointment for collecting demographic, psychosocial
      and behavioral measures and a thorough substance use history. Three days later
      the participants returned for a neuroimaging appointment. Prior to their scanning
      session, participants were asked to be abstinent from MJ use for 72h, from alcohol
      for 24h, and from caffeine and cigarettes for the preceding 2h. These were confirmed
      by self-report (MJ, alcohol, caffeine and cigarettes), quantitative THC urinalysis
      (MJ), and by breath alcohol level of .000 (alcohol) at the start of their session.
      \n\n### Participants \n  \nWe scanned 45 regular heavy MJ users as part of the
      parent project. Inclusion criteria were: right-handedness, English as the primary
      language and no histories of psychosis, traumatic brain injury, and MRI contraindications
      (e.g., pregnancy, non-removal metallic implants, claustrophobia). One subject
      reported a history of anxiety and depression and one other reported a history
      of ADHD as a child. Additional exclusions for the current study included: Axis
      I diagnosis (via SCID) other than cannabis use disorder, unusable sMRI due to
      motion artifact or poor signal-to-noise ratio that precluded accurate tissue
      segmentation (  n  =1) and incomplete drug use histories (  n  =2). Of the 42
      remaining cases, 22 were early onset users (onset of first use before age 16).
      Group categorization using onset of regular use as opposed to onset of first
      use maintained the same grouping (mean early onset of regular use=16.5, mean
      late onset of regular use=19.0). Regular use was defined as at least one time
      per week. To determine how age of onset of regular MJ use influenced our reported
      effects, we performed these analyses while covarying for age of onset of regular
      use (see  ).   summarizes demographic and substance use information according
      to onset status.   summarizes the correlation between age and identified marijuana
      use variables. Only MJ years of use and current age showed a statistically significant
      correlation. Participants were recruited based on self-reported daily MJ use
      and a positive urinalysis for THC metabolites at their baseline visit. All of
      the participants were screened via urinalysis for other drugs of abuse and were
      excluded if drugs (other than MJ) were detected. Participants were required
      to have used MJ for a minimum of 5000 lifetime occasions and self-report daily
      use (without >24h abstinence) for the last 60 days.   \nSample characteristics.

      acquisition \n  \nScanning sessions took place at the Advanced Imaging Research
      Center at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center three days following
      their initial visit. Another verification of THC metabolites via urinalysis
      was also performed before the scan. MRI images were collected using a 3T Philips
      whole-body scanner equipped with Quasar gradient subsystem (40mT/m amplitude,
      a slew rate of 220mT/m/ms). High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical scans were
      collected using a MPRAGE sequence: TR/TE/TI=2100/3.70/1100ms; flip angle=12;
      field of view=256mm256mm; slab thickness=160mm (along left-right direction);
      voxel size=1mm1mm1mm, Total scan time=3m 57s. \n\n\n#### Image processing \n  \nMPRAGE
      anatomical scans were pre-processed for surface-based analyses using FreeSurfer
      v5.3 semi-automated pipeline ( ). This semi-automated pipeline included spatial
      (Talairach) and signal intensity normalization of images, volumetric segmentation
      and subcortical labeling ( ,  ). Outer gray matter and white matter boundaries
      were then identified and reconstructed into a mesh of over 150,000 tessellated
      vertices to allow point-to-point surface measures ( ). Next, gyral anatomy is
      aligned to a standard spherical template using surface convexity and curvature
      measures. Resulting surfaces were inspected, blind to MJ onset status, to identify
      and correct any errors made during cortical reconstruction. Modifications to
      the volumes were made as necessary to correct for tissue misclassifications
      according to FreeSurfer''s wiki manual ( ). In preparation for analysis, each
      morphological measure for each case was co-registered to a standard template
      (fsaverage). Anatomical labels in FreeSurfer ( ) were used for interpretation
      of results. \n\n\n\n### Morphological measures \n  \n#### Cortical thickness
      \n  \nThe width of the cortical ribbon was measured as the distance between
      corresponding vertices of the white matter and gray matter surfaces at each
      vertex in the cortical mantel ( ). \n\n\n#### Graywhite matter ratio (GWR) \n  \nTo
      assess the quality of cortical ribbon definition, a tissue contrast between
      gray and white matter signal intensities was computed as a percent ratio (WG)/(.5*(W+G))
      (from pctsurfcon v1.11.2.1, inbuilt component of FreeSurfer pipeline v5.3, 2011).
      White matter signal intensities were measured at an absolute length of 1mm below
      the graywhite border surface and gray matter signal was measured 30% into the
      cortical ribbon ( ). \n\n\n#### Local gyrification index \n  \nThe cortical
      surface from FreeSurfer''s main pipeline is further processed to create an outer
      surface that encapsulates the gyral and sulcal curvature for each hemisphere,
      which serves as a basis for calculating a local gyrification index ( ). LGI
      is measured as the amount of cortex within the sulcal folds beneath the outer
      surface compared to the amount of visible cortex that touches the outer surface.
      Cortical maps are generated from repeated iterations of delineating a 25mm radius
      sphere on the outer surface and its corresponding point on the cortical surface
      using a matching algorithm. \n\n\n\n### Background and premorbid characteristics
      \n  \n#### Sample characteristics \n  \nAge, gender, education level, ethnicity,
      along with other background information, was obtained using a standard demographics
      questionnaire. The two-subtest administration of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale
      of Intelligence (Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning) provided estimates of intellect
      ( ). \n\n\n#### Substance use \n  \nThe Substance Use Disorder modules of the
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) ( ) were administered by a trained
      research assistant to assess for lifetime and current symptoms of abuse and
      dependence for alcohol, nicotine, MJ and other substances. The SCID interview
      also provided the onset of use information. A Time Line Follow-Back (TLFB) approach
      was used to quantify alcohol, nicotine, and MJ use patterns for 90 days prior
      to study participation ( ). Marijuana use in grams was obtained via self-report
      in response to probes aimed at quantifying their regular use. \n\n\n\n### Statistical
      analyses \n  \nStatistical analyses were conducted in SPSS 18.0 for behavioral
      and psychosocial measures whereas general linear model group comparisons on
      surfaced-based morphology measures were carried out FreeSurfer''s built-in application
      QDEC (v1.5). Independent samples   t  -tests, MannWhitney   U  -tests or chi-square
      tests, compared groups on background and demographic variables (see  ). Before
      statistical analysis was conducted, the dependent measures of cortical thickness,
      GWR and LGI were smoothed using a FWHM Gaussian filter with a width of either
      10 or 15mm. Separate univariate general linear model (GLM) was then used to
      model cortical thickness, GWR and LGI with onset status of MJ use as a between
      groups factor. The dependent variables were thickness, graywhite ratio or local
      gyrification index and the independent variables were either recent monthly
      MJ use in grams (MJ grams) or duration of MJ use (MJ years). Age and total drinks
      in the past 2 months were treated as nuisance covariates in the model. Using
      MJ years of use and MJ grams as independent predictors of interest allowed us
      to characterize and differentiate the latent developmental effects from cumulative
      and current effects of MJ use. The variable marijuana years of use was based
      on the participants response to the question For how many years have you been
      using marijuana regularly? Of note, an outlier in the early onset group was
      removed before the statistical comparisons were performed. \n\n\n\n## Results
      \n  \n### Cortical thickness \n  \nThere were no regions of group differences
      in cortical thickness by early onset status alone, controlled for age and alcohol
      use. However, MJ use characteristics were correlated with anterior dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex thickness based on onset status. Early onset users showed
      increased thickness with increased MJ grams while late onset users showed thinner
      cortex with increased MJ grams (  p  <0.05 uncorrected) ( ). The same pattern
      emerged with more years of MJ use being associated with thicker region of the
      right medial temporal lobe in the early onset users and the reverse for the
      late onset users (  p  <0.05 uncorrected) ( ).   \nClusters of significant age
      of onsetmarijuana use interactions. GWR, gray/white matter border ratio; LGI,
      local gyrification index. \n        \nEarly vs. late onset marijuana users show
      divergent morphological patterns based on current marijuana use (measured in
      grams; MJ grams) in overlapping areas of anterior prefrontal cortex. GWR, gray/white
      matter border ratio; LGI, local gyrification index. \n  \n\n\n### Graywhite
      matter contrast \n  \nThere were no regions of group differences in graywhite
      matter contrast by early onset status alone, controlled for age and alcohol
      use. However, current MJ consumption (grams) and onset status were differentially
      correlated with graywhite matter contrast in a left anterior dorsal frontal
      region (  p  <0.05, FWE corrected). Increased graywhite contrast with heavier
      MJ use was seen in the early onset users and the opposite was seen in later
      onset users (heavier current use linked to decreasing GWR). The same pattern
      was seen between duration of MJ use in two prefrontal cortex clusters of the
      right dorsal frontal and medial orbitofrontal area   p  <0.05, FWE corrected  more
      years of MJ use were linked to greater GWR among early users ( ). \n\n\n###
      Gyrification \n  \nMJ use onset status alone showed no significant main effects
      above age and alcohol covariates. However, onset status was correlated with
      divergent patterns between local gyrification and MJ use, whereby early onset
      users showed decreasing LGI with increasing MJ consumption and longer duration
      of use in prefrontal cortex regions   p  <0.05, FWE corrected. The left hemisphere
      clusters encompassed the majority of the length of the middle lateral surface
      of the left cortex, including motor cortices, parietal lobe and multimodal integration
      areas ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study was designed to characterize
      the cortical architecture in adolescent onset MJ users by comparing early adolescent
      onset users to late adolescent onset in MJ use on measures of cortical thickness,
      gray/white matter contrast and gyrification. The primary finding was that early
      versus late onset MJ users showed a divergent pattern in cortical thickness,
      definition of the cortical ribbon and local gyrification with continued use
      through and beyond adolescent years. Specifically, early onset users showed
      cortical thickening, enhanced gray/white matter contrast, and decreased gyrification
      in association with more years of MJ use and current consumption of MJ in grams
      in frontal and temporal regions  areas that underlie higher order cognition
      including executive functioning, learning and memory. Findings were above and
      beyond effects of alcohol and current age, therefore, results are less likely
      to reflect morphological trends due to aging. \n\nOur findings did not find
      the expected age of onset differences previously reported in marijuana users
      ( ,  ). This inconsistency suggests that the age of onset effects may be more
      robust in brain white matter connectivity ( ) and function ( ) than brain surface
      morphometry. To date, the few studies that have described altered cortical morphology
      in MJ users have led to mixed findings.   identified brain regions with decreased
      sulcal depth suggestive of lower gyrification in a study of adult MJ users.   recently
      reported increased cortical thickness in the entorhinal cortex among 24 adolescent
      MJ users (mean age=17.7, mean MJ onset age=15.4) relative to peer controls.
      However, the authors also reported a negative relationship between cortical
      thickness and total MJ use in the right paracentral gyrus, and they observed
      consistent positive relationships in various brain regions between age of MJ
      onset and thickness. In the only other known adolescent study of cortical thickness
      and MJ, Lopez-Larson and colleagues studied 18 adolescent heavy MJ users (similar
      in age and MJ onset as  ) and reported mixed findings of increased thickness
      in prefrontal/insula regions and decreased thickness in posterior/temporal lobe
      areas in the MJ users compared to controls. In contrast to  ,   found areas
      of the frontal lobe and insula that were thinner with increased urine THC metabolites
      and thicker with earlier age of onset. Select findings from the current study
      align with aspects of both of these studies, with a consensus supporting findings
      of a negative dose-dependent relationship between MJ use and cortical thickness.
      Given the low availability of studies to compare, this consensus is very limited.
      Although Jacobus et al. and Lopez-Larson et al. found the opposite effect of
      age of onset on thickness, the pattern of divergence among early vs. late onset
      users in the current study is more consistent with the latter study, whereby
      we saw early onset users exhibit thicker cortex with continued MJ use. Taken
      together, findings of increased thickness related to early MJ onset accompanied
      by negative dose-dependent relationships with MJ exposure may reflect two distinct
      processes. One process may be specific to the interactions with cortical development
      during early adolescence, likely leading to a disruption in pruning, and, the
      other, specific to the pharmacological effect with heavy chronic MJ use. \n\nIn
      the only known study to examine the curvature-morphology of the cortex in adult
      MJ users,   identified decreased sulcal concavity and thinner sulci in 23MJ
      users compared to controls (  n  =44), also in prefrontal areas. However, they
      did not observe significant relationships with age, MJ onset age, or cumulative
      MJ use. It is interesting that the authors detected group level differences
      (MJ vs. controls) but no correlations with MJ use characteristics such as dose
      or age of onset, whereas our primary findings are the consistent effects of
      continued MJ use differing after early or late adolescent onset. There are substantial
      methodological explanations for this disparity. For example, the current study
      did not compare morphology in MJ users to a normative control sample, therefore,
      it is feasible that group-level differences may emerge with such a comparison.
      Likewise, we deliberately covaried for current age in order to control for brain
      changes with aging and thus optimize our interrogation of developmental effects
      of early onset age and of aspects of continued use. \n\nThe heterogeneity of
      MJ effects clearly suggests a multifactorial system of neurobiological processes
      involved. The primary results uphold that age of onset is a robust variable
      that differentiates heavy MJ users based on early versus late MJ onset. However,
      this group distinction relied on current use characteristics. Therefore, in
      the absence of group-level differences, the interactions between onset age and
      current use indicates that continued cannabis exposure and early adolescent
      developmental factors both contribute to a dynamic and sustained departure from
      what is expected based on developmental studies. \n\nTypical synaptic refinement
      processes during early adolescence are in the context of long-term depression
      and potentiation of cortical neurons in order to facilitate neuronal remodeling.
      Thus, the normal course of early adolescent development is uniquely vulnerable
      to disruption by MJ due to the electrochemical conditions and maturity of brain
      processes that would not present together again. Cass and colleagues tested
      the sensitivity of early adolescence cannabinoid exposure in an animal model
      ( ). They found that acute administration of cannabinoid agonists in early,
      middle and late adolescent rats led to a state of frequency-dependent disinhibition
      of neurons in the frontal cortex in the early-to-middle adolescent rats, but
      not in the late adolescent rats. Moreover, the authors also noted that adult
      rats previously exposed to cannabinoid agonists in adolescence displayed comparable
      neuronal disinhibition. Thus, by changing the inhibitory/excitatory landscape
      during adolescence, MJ can influence lasting changes to typical cortical remodeling
      during sensitive early adolescent years. \n\nThe sequence of pruning and myelination
      likely plays a formative role in lasting changes from early adolescent onset
      MJ use. With decreased synaptic elimination, our findings of greater GW border
      contrast may reflect greater proliferation of myelin at the boundary of the
      cortical ribbon where non-pruned synapses remained with linked axons. Findings
      of altered white matter tissue qualities are mixed in adolescent and adult MJ
      user samples. Some report both increases and decreases in fractional anisotropy
      (FA) and average water diffusion ( ) whereas others report consistent decreases
      in FA among adolescent MJ users ( ,  ) or null findings ( ). Two studies of
      diffusion tensor imaging in adult MJ users reported reduced FA in users compared
      to controls ( ,  ). In addition to equivocal findings, research is needed to
      address the microstructural changes that could result in altered definition
      of the cortical ribbon. For example, rather than whole brain techniques that
      assess diffusion measures along major white matter tracts, indices assessing
      axonal organization along radial and interneuron association fibers along the
      cortical ribbon are needed. This scenario played out could result in increased
      gray matter (thicker cortex from disrupted pruning) and the myelination of connections
      to these spared terminals would result in increased density of white matter
      at the cortical boundary. Without any known studies of adolescent development
      of the gray/white tissue contrast at the cortical border to serve as a point
      of comparison, we speculate that early adolescent disruption of pruning and
      subsequent myelination of connections at the cortical boundary would be reflected
      by increased GWR as we saw in the current study. \n\n\n## Limitations and conclusions
      \n  \nThe cross-sectional nature of this study limits causal attributions in
      terms of what we can infer to be directly related to the effects of MJ. Although
      a longitudinal design is optimal for addressing brain changes directly due to
      MJ, cross-sectional studies facilitate data-driven hypotheses that can be assessed
      directly in prospective studies. \n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the
      participants were not explicitly asked for possible years of abstinence during
      their period of regular use, which may have created possible inflation in reported
      duration of regular use. However, because the participants provided number of
      years of regular marijuana use, this inherently suggests continued, uninterrupted
      years of use. Concurrent nicotine use could have also influenced our reported
      results. But in the absence of a larger sample size and the presence of huge
      variance in nicotine use in the current sample, we were unable to verify the
      effect of nicotine use in the reported results. \n\nInterpretation of these
      findings is also limited by the lack of behavioral anchors for the observed
      morphological effects and lack of information on other aspects of developmental
      history that could further characterize the effects of marijuana during neurodevelopment.
      This is further limited by the absence of expected patterns based on normative
      data. Given the varied directions of effects and the small sample size, these
      findings should be replicated and be viewed as preliminary. \n\nTo conclude,
      early MJ use was linked to altered neurodevelopmental patterns in brain regions
      sub-serving higher-order cognitive process. Clinical implications include need
      for early, targeted intervention. Given that the most robust results were related
      to interactions between onset age and continued use through emerging adulthood,
      harm reduction approaches may be effective in moderating adolescent MJ use to
      levels that are less likely to cause long-term developmental changes. \n\n\n##

      the meaning of abstract mathematical symbols is a cornerstone of arithmetic
      learning in children. Studies have long focused on the role of spatial intuitions
      in the processing of numerals. However, it has been argued that such intuitions
      may also underlie symbols that convey fundamental arithmetic concepts, such
      as arithmetic operators. In the present cross-sectional study, we used fMRI
      to investigate how and when associations between arithmetic operators and brain
      regions processing spatial information emerge in children from 3rd to 10th grade.
      We found that the mere perception of a + sign elicited grade-related increases
      of spatial activity in the right hippocampus. That is, merely perceiving + signs  without
      any operands  elicited enhanced hippocampal activity after around 7th grade
      (1213 years old). In these children, hippocampal activity in response to a +
      sign was further correlated with the degree to which calculation performance
      was facilitated by the preview of that sign before an addition problem, an effect
      termed operator-priming. Grade-related increases of hippocampal spatial activity
      were operation-specific because they were not observed with  signs, which might
      evoke rote retrieval rather than numerical manipulation. Our study raises the
      possibility that hippocampal spatial mechanisms help build associations between
      some arithmetic operators and space throughout age and/or education.Keywords:
      Arithmetic, Development, Attention, Space, fMRI, Hippocampus1.IntroductionHumans
      are unique in their ability to represent abstract mathematical concepts by culturally
      invented symbols, such as Arabic numerals and arithmetic signs. Because these
      symbols are arbitrary, learning the relationship between their identity and
      the concept they represent is a challenge during early math education in children.
      Most prior studies have focused on the mechanisms supporting the acquisition
      of symbols representing numerical quantities (Piazza et al., 2007, Ansari, 2008,
      Holloway and Ansari, 2009, Lyons and Ansari, 2009, Mundy and Gilmore, 2009).
      However, efficient processing of symbols that convey fundamental arithmetic
      concepts (i.e., operators) may be an important and largely neglected aspect
      of arithmetic skills. This is suggested by the operator-priming effect (Roussel
      et al., 2002, Fayol and Thevenot, 2012, Mathieu et al., 2017), whereby the anticipated
      presentation of a + or - sign 150ms before a single-digit addition or subtraction
      problem facilitates problem-solving in adults.What aspect of the processing
      of an operator may cause the operator-priming effect in adults? A first possibility
      is that an arithmetic sign may automatically evoke a network of facts. For example,
      the perception of a + or - sign might pre-activate a network of additive or
      subtractive facts that would have been built in declarative memory after years
      of practice (Campbell and Xue, 2001, Ashcraft, 1992). Pre-activating such a
      network would facilitate the retrieval of the answer from memory when operands
      are presented. A second possibility is that an arithmetic sign may prime a specific
      procedure that would have been automatized after its repeated practice during
      arithmetic learning. For instance, Fayol and Thevenot argued that perceiving
      a + or - sign might trigger an automatized procedure that could be linked to
      the convocation of the mental number line and could correspond to a preparation
      for a quick left-to-right or right-to-left browsing of this mental line (Fayol
      and Thevenot, 2012). This proposal echoes the idea that adding or subtracting
      numbers involves rightward and leftward shifts of attention from a source to
      a target number along a mental map of numbers oriented from left to right, i.e.,
      the mental number line (MNL) (Hubbard et al., 2005, Masson and Pesenti, 2014,
      Mathieu et al., 2016, Pinheiro-Chagas et al., 2017). Pre-activating such a procedure
      would result in a facilitation of subsequent calculation when operands are presented,
      thereby explaining the operator-priming effect.Interestingly, two lines of evidence
      favor the procedural over the declarative interpretation of the operator-priming
      effect. First, the effect is not observed with the  sign and multiplication
      problems (Roussel et al., 2002, Mathieu et al., 2017). Multiplication problems,
      however, are explicitly learned by rote in school and multiplication is unanimously
      viewed as the operation having the strongest association with a network of facts
      in memory (Campbell and Xue, 2001, Galfano et al., 2003, Thibodeau et al., 1996).
      Therefore, the lack of operator-priming effect for multiplication problems is
      difficult to reconcile with the idea that the effect is due to associations
      between operators and networks of stored facts. Second, in line with Fayol and
      Thevenots proposal that + and  signs may prime a spatial scanning of the MNL,
      a recent study suggests that + and  signs do evoke spatial intuitions. Specifically,
      Pinhas et al. (2014) found that, when instructed to categorize + and  signs
      with left-hand or right-hand responses, adults tend to respond faster to + signs
      with the right hand than with the left hand, whereas they tend to respond faster
      to - signs with the left hand than with the right hand (Pinhas et al., 2014).
      Thus, + and  signs appear to have some automatic associations with the right
      and left sides of space, respectively.Using fMRI, we recently found that such
      spatial associations may stem from the fact that some arithmetic operators are
      automatically processed in brain regions involved in spatial attention in adults.
      We showed that the mere perception of a + sign elicits greater activity than
      the mere perception of a  sign in brain regions underlying overt spatial attention.
      These included the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the posterior superior parietal
      lobule (PSPL) (Mathieu et al., 2017). Thus, perceiving a + sign (but not a  sign)
      may be associated with a deployment of spatial attention in educated adults.
      Therefore, the rightward shifts of attention that have been posited to underlie
      addition problem-solving (Hubbard et al., 2005, Masson and Pesenti, 2014, Mathieu
      et al., 2016) might be primed by the mere preview of the addition sign (but
      not by the preview of a multiplication sign because multiplication is typically
      learned by rote and unlikely to be associated with movements along the MNL).
      Overall, there is mounting evidence that at least some arithmetic operators
      (e.g., + but not  signs) evoke spatial intuitions in adults, and that these
      intuitions may relate to the operator-priming effect.However, associations between
      operators and space are arguably not innate. Therefore, a fundamental outstanding
      question is how and when such associations emerge in the developing brain. To
      answer that question, we studied 34 children from 3rd to 10th grade while they
      performed 3 tasks. First, fMRI activity was measured while children were instructed
      to make eye saccades towards visually presented targets. This allowed us to
      precisely localize several regions of interest (ROIs) involved in spatial attention
      across children. Second, fMRI activity was measured in these spatial attention
      ROIs while children were presented with trials in which a + sign was displayed
      without any operands (hereafter addition sign-only trials). As in our previous
      study in adults (Mathieu et al., accepted), activity during the perception of
      addition sign-only trials was compared to activity associated with trials in
      which a  sign was displayed without any operands (hereafter multiplication sign-only
      trials) because these do not appear to evoke any specific intuitions in adults
      (Fayol and Thevenot 2012). This allowed us to identify the spatial attention
      ROIs in which activity in response to a + sign (as compared to a  sign) increases
      with age and/or education, as well as the developmental time course of these
      effects.1 Third, outside of the scanner, we asked subjects to perform an operator-priming
      task and measured the correlation between inter-individual differences in the
      size of the operator-priming effect and inter-individual differences in sign-related
      activity in spatial attention ROIs as a function of grade. This allowed us to
      evaluate when sign-related activity in spatial attention ROIs leads to an operator-priming
      effect in children.2.Material and methods2.1. ParticipantsForty-two right-handed
      children from 3rd to 10th grade participated in the study. All were native French
      speakers. Participants did not have prior history of neurological disease, psychiatric
      disorders, learning disabilities or attention deficits. All children and parents
      provided written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved
      by the local ethics committee (CPP Sud-Est-II). Families received 80 for their
      participation. Data from 8 subjects were excluded because of excessive head-movement
      in the scanner (see criteria in the Section 2.7., n=3), poor whole-brain coverage
      (i.e. susceptibility artefacts from dental braces, n=3) and unacceptably low
      performance during the task (i.e., lower than 50% accuracy on the sign-plus-operand
      trials, n=2). Therefore, the final sample consisted of 34 children (20 males)
      from 3rd to 10th grade (age range: 815, mean age=11.37, SD=1.84). For each child,
      a continuous measure of grade was calculated by taking into account the specific
      date within the grade year when that child was scanned. The whole sample (n=34)
      was evenly split into three groups as a function of grade: 11 children were
      from the lower grades group (grade 3.25.4; mean=4.4), 11 children were from
      the intermediate grades group (grade 5.66.9; mean=6.2), and 12 children were
      from the higher grades group (grade 7.610.2; mean=8.5).2.2. Standardized measuresChildren
      were administered standardized tests of intellectual and arithmetic abilities
      to ensure that there were no age differences with respect to those measures.
      Full-scale IQ was measured using the NEMI-2 (Cognet, 2006). Basic arithmetic
      knowledge was evaluated with the Math-Fluency subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson-III
      Tests of Achievement (WJ-III) (Woodcock et al., 2001). Across all participants,
      standardized (i.e., age-normalized) scores on IQ (mean=112; SD=10) and Math
      Fluency (mean=106; SD=16) tests were within the normal range. One-way ANOVAs
      with the between-subject factor group (lower, intermediate, higher grades) revealed
      no main effect of group on IQ (F(2,31)=0.591, p=0.560, BF10=0.29), indicating
      that age-normalized intellectual abilities were similar across groups. However,
      there was a main effect of group on Math Fluency (F(2,31)=5.867, p=0.007, BF10=7.24):
      Children from intermediate grades had a higher age-normalized score (mean=118;
      SD=18) than children from lower (mean=100; SD=11) and higher grades (mean=100;
      SD=13). Therefore, we included standardized Math-Fluency scores as nuisance
      covariate in all of our analyses.2.3. Behavioral sessionAfter standardized testing,
      children participated in a behavioral session during which they performed an
      operator-priming task adapted from Fayol and Thevenot (2012) and Roussel et
      al. (2002). Children were asked to evaluate 56 single-digit addition and 56
      multiplication problems composed of operands between 2 and 9. Problems were
      presented in both commutative orders. Tie problems were excluded. Problems with
      a sum smaller than or equal to 11 and a product smaller or equal to 24 were
      considered small. Other problems were considered large.In each trial, a problem
      was presented with an answer (Fig. 1a). The arithmetic sign was presented either
      150ms before (Negative SOA condition) or at the same time (Null SOA condition)
      as the operands (Fig. 1a). All problems were presented once in both SOA condition
      with a valid answer. Twenty-eight addition and 28 multiplication problems were
      also presented in both SOA condition with an invalid answer (obtained by adding
      or subtracting 1 to or from the valid answer). Trials were pseudorandomly ordered
      so that no more than three problems of the same type appeared consecutively.
      Problems with an invalid answer were randomly chosen across subjects and the
      order of blocks was counter-balanced between subjects. The experiment started
      with 8 practice trials.Open in a separate windowFig. 1Experimental design. (a)
      During the behavioral session, children (n=34) were asked to evaluate the result
      of single-digit addition and multiplication problems. For both operations, the
      arithmetic sign was presented either 150ms before (negative SOA trials), or
      at the same time as the operands (null SOA trials). (b) In the scanner, children
      (n=34) performed an arithmetic task during which they were presented with sign-only
      (left) and sign-plus-operands (right) addition, multiplication and baseline
      trials. In each trial, a sign (+,  or ) was presented at the center of the screen
      for 150ms. In sign-only trials, the trial ended with the presentation of the
      sign and was simply followed by the inter-trial period of fixation. In sign-plus-operands
      trials (filler trials), the + or  sign was immediately followed by a single-digit
      addition or multiplication problem (respectively) presented along an answer
      and the  sign was followed by 3 letters. In those cases, children had 5000ms
      to evaluate whether the answer of the problem was true or false or to indicate
      whether one of the 3 letters was a B.The experiment was controlled by Presentation
      software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA). Problems were displayed in white
      Arial 60-point font on a black background. All trials started with the presentation
      of a white central fixation dot for 1500ms, immediately followed by a red central
      fixation dot for 1000ms signaling that the problem was about to be presented,
      either in the negative SOA condition or in the null SOA condition (Fig. 1a).
      Subjects had a maximum of 5000ms to evaluate whether the response was valid
      or invalid as quickly as possible by pressing one of two keys on the computer
      keyboard.2.4. fMRI sessionDuring fMRI scanning, children performed a spatial
      attention localizer task and an arithmetic task. The spatial attention localizer
      task consisted in alternating blocks of fixation and saccades. During saccade
      blocks (n=9), participants were asked to make saccades towards several successive
      target dots. Each saccade block contained 16 target dots (0.2 visual angle)
      that appeared at random positions with an eccentricity of 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5
      or 5.5 in the left or right visual field for an average of 800ms (with a jitter
      of 200ms). During fixation blocks (n=9), participants were asked to maintain
      fixation on a central dot for 12,800ms. Block order was counterbalanced across
      children.During the arithmetic task, children were presented with sign-only
      and sign-plus-operands versions of addition and multiplication trials (Fig.
      1b). Each trial started with the presentation of either a + or a  sign at the
      center of the screen for 150ms. In sign-only trials (n=30), the trial ended
      with the presentation of the sign and was simply followed by the inter-trial
      period of fixation (see below). These sign-only trials were our trials of interest
      and allowed us to isolate neural activity due to the presentation of a sign
      alone. We also included in the experiment sign-plus-operands trials (n=50).
      In those filler trials, the + or  sign was immediately followed by a single-digit
      addition or multiplication problem (respectively) presented with an answer.
      Participants were asked to indicate whether the answer was true or false. The
      goal of these filler trials (for which associated activity would be difficult
      to interpret because any effects could be attributable to the anticipatory presentation
      of the operator, the appearance of the operands, or a combination of both of
      these factors) was only to keep children engaged and attentive in the scanner.
      They also induced an arithmetic context, thereby ensuring that the + and  signs
      presented in sign-only trials were perceived as arithmetic signs. Problems in
      sign-plus-operand trials were constructed following the same criteria as in
      the behavioral session. Finally, the baseline consisted in trials in which the
      arithmetic sign was replaced by an abstract non-arithmetic sign (i.e., ). We
      included 30 baseline sign-only trials (in which the  sign was presented in isolation)
      and 50 baseline sign-plus-operand trials (in which the  sign was followed by
      3 letters and participants had to indicate whether one of these letters was
      a B). All trials were followed by a variable period of visual fixation ranging
      from 3000ms to 3800ms. That period consisted in a central white fixation dot
      that turned red 1000ms before the onset of the next trial. The arithmetic task
      was decomposed in 4 functional runs. All trials were intermixed and the timing
      and order of trial presentation within each run was optimized for estimation
      efficiency using optseq2 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/optseq/). Behavioral
      responses were recorded using an MR-compatible response device.Stimuli were
      generated using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA).
      Prior scanning, children were familiarized with the fMRI environment during
      a practice session that took place after the standardized testing and the behavioral
      session. During this practice session, children learned to minimize head movement
      in a mock fMRI scanner. The actual scanning session took place no more than
      3 weeks after the practice session.2.5. Behavioral analysesRT data associated
      with the operator-priming task were normalized using a logarithmic transformation
      prior all analyses to improve the conformity of the data to the standard assumptions
      of parametric testing. Following Fayol and Thevenot (2012), mean RT was analyzed
      using planned comparisons that followed from a within-subject ANOVA with the
      factors Operation (Addition/Multiplication) and SOA (Negative/Null), conducted
      separately for each group. We report for all effects the corresponding Bayes
      factors (BF10), indicating the strength of evidence for the alternative hypothesis
      (H1) relative to the null hypothesis (H0). Substantial evidence in favor of
      the alternative hypothesis is typically suggested by a BF10 greater than 3 (Jeffreys,
      1961, Dienes, 2011).2.6. fMRI data acquisitionImages were collected with a Siemens
      Prisma 3T MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) at the CERMEP
      Imagerie du vivant in Lyon, France. The BOLD signal was measured with a susceptibility
      weighted single-shot EPI sequence. Imaging parameters were as follows: TR=2000ms,
      TE=24ms, flip angle=80, matrix size=128120, field of view=220206mm, slice thickness=3mm
      (0.48mm gap), number of slices=32. A high-resolution T1-weighted whole-brain
      anatomical volume was also collected for each participant. Parameters were as
      follows: TR=3500ms, TE=2.24ms, flip angle=8, matrix size=256256, field of view=224224mm,
      slice thickness=0.9mm, number of slices=192.2.7. fMRI preprocessingData analysis
      was performed using SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Functional images
      were corrected for slice acquisition delays and spatially realigned to the first
      image of the first run. Images were then spatially smoothed with a Gaussian
      filter equal to twice the voxel size. ArtRepair was used to help remove motion
      from the functional images prior to normalization (Mazaika et al., 2009). Volumes
      with rapid scan-to-scan movements of greater than 1.5mm were repaired by interpolation
      of the two nearest non-repaired scans. Each run with more than 5% of the total
      number of volumes replaced was removed from the analyses. A subject was excluded
      from further analysis if more than one run was removed. The number of volumes
      replaced did not differ between grade groups (F(2,31)=2.20; p=0.13). Finally,
      functional images were normalized into the standard MNI space (normalized voxel
      size, 223.5mm3).2.8. fMRI processingEvent-related statistical analysis was performed
      according to the general linear model (GLM). For the localizer task, brain activity
      associated with saccades and fixation blocks was modeled as epochs with onsets
      and offsets time-locked to the beginning and the end of each block. Each epoch
      was convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the time
      series data from each run were high-pass filtered (1/128Hz). Finally, serial
      correlations were corrected using an autoregressive AR(1) model. Following our
      previous study using the same task in adults (Mathieu et al., 2017), brain activity
      associated with sign-only trials during the arithmetic task was estimated using
      a finite impulse response (FIR) model. We modeled 8 time points with an interval
      of 2s (corresponding to one TR) ranging from the onset of the sign to 16s after
      the sign. The magnitude of the fMRI response for each type of sign-only trial
      was calculated by subtracting activity at the onset of the sign (i.e., 1st bin,
      or 0s after the onset) from the peak activity (i.e., 4th bin, or 8s after the
      onset). The time series data from each run were high-pass filtered (1/128Hz),
      and serial correlations were corrected using an autoregressive AR(1) model.2.9.
      Region of interest (ROI) definition and analysesThe present study used a Region-of-Interest
      (ROI) approach to analyze brain activity associated with sign-only trials in
      brain regions involved in the orienting of spatial attention in children. All
      ROIs were independently defined using the contrast of saccades versus fixation
      blocks in the spatial attention localizer task. All subject-specific contrasts
      were entered into a random effect (RFX) one-sample t-test across subjects. The
      RFX contrast map was then thresholded across the whole-brain using an uncorrected
      voxel-level threshold of p<0.001 and a false-discovery-rate (FDR) corrected
      cluster-level threshold of p<0.05 (Chumbley and Friston 2009). Using the SPM
      toolbox Marsbar (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/), ROIs were defined as 6-mm
      radius spheres around the peak coordinate of each region.Within each ROI and
      for each participant, we calculated the average response (parameter estimates)
      for + signs using the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline
      sign-only trials. Similarly, we calculated the average response for  signs using
      the contrast of multiplication sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials.
      Two analyses were performed in each ROI. First, we identified the ROI(s) in
      which a difference in fMRI activity between + and  signs emerged throughout
      age and/or education, using a 32 ANOVA with the between-subject factor group
      (lower/intermediate/higher grades) and the within-subject factor sign (+/).
      Second, we tested in these ROIs whether inter-individual differences in the
      fMRI response to an arithmetic sign were correlated with inter-individual differences
      in the size of the operator-priming effect (measured in the behavioral session)
      for each group. In all analyses, we report uncorrected P values as well as P
      values corrected for multiple comparisons across all identified ROIs using the
      Bonferroni procedure. Bayes factor are also reported.3.Results3.1. The spatial
      localizer task activates a brain network encompassing frontal, parietal, occipital
      and hippocampal regionsContrasting saccades to fixation blocks in the spatial
      attention localizer task, we first identified 10 clusters supporting the orienting
      of spatial attention across subjects: the bilateral Frontal Eye Field (FEF),
      bilateral Posterior Superior Parietal Lobule (PSPL), bilateral Middle Temporal
      Gyri (MTG), bilateral Middle Occipital Gyri (MOG), right dorsal Inferior Frontal
      Gyrus (dIFG), and right Hippocampus (see Table 1 and Fig. 2). Therefore, a large
      brain network was involved in the orienting of spatial attention across subjects.
      Each of these regions served as an ROI in subsequent analyses.Table 1Brain regions

      region identified by the spatial localizer task is increasingly activated in
      response to a + sign but not to a  sign throughout age and/or educationA 32
      ANOVA with the between-subject factor group (lower/intermediate/higher grades)
      and the within-subject factor sign (+/) was then conducted in each of the 10
      ROIs identified by the spatial attention localizer. We found an interaction
      between group and sign in the right hippocampus (F(2.30)=6.75, p=0.0038, pcorr=0.038;
      Fig. 3a and b), but not in any other ROIs (all Fs<3.44, all ps>0.046, all pscorr>0.46).
      Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for this interaction in
      the right hippocampus (BF10=11.53), while no or anecdotal evidence for such
      an interaction was found in the other ROIs (BF10<1.63). Follow-up t-tests in
      the hippocampus ROI revealed that children from higher grades (average grade=8.5)
      exhibited greater activity for addition than multiplication sign-only trials
      (t11=3.02, p=0.012), whereas there was no difference between signs in children
      from intermediate grades (average grade=6.2) (t10=0.87, p=0.41) and even a trend
      for less activity for addition than multiplication sign-only trials in children
      from lower grades (average grade=4.4) (t10=2.22, p=0.051). Bayes Factor analysis
      indicated substantial evidence for a difference of activity between addition
      and multiplication sign-only trials in children from higher grades (BF10=5.21),
      but evidence for this difference was absent in intermediate grades (BF10=0.41)
      and anecdotal in lower grades (BF10=1.69). Finally, across all groups, addition
      sign-only trials were associated with greater activity than baseline sign-only
      trials in children from higher grades (t11=2.63, p=0.023), but not in any other
      groups (all ts<1.32, all ps>0.21). Multiplication sign-only trials were associated
      with greater activity than baseline sign-only trials in none of the groups (all
      ts<1.38, all ps>0.20). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence
      for a difference between addition sign-only trials and baseline sign-only trials
      in children from higher grades (BF10=3.00), but no or anecdotal evidence in
      the other groups (all BF10s<0.60) and for multiplication sign-only trials (all
      BF10s<0.63). Overall, then, a difference in fMRI response to a + and a  sign
      emerged throughout age and/or education in the right hippocampus.Open in a separate
      windowFig. 3Grade-related changes of activity in the right hippocampus.(a) Location

      age=9.4), intermediate (n=11; grade 5.66.9; mean grade=6.2; mean age=11.1) and
      higher grades (n=12; grade 7.610.2; mean grade=8.5; mean age=13.4). (c) Difference
      in activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials over grade
      in the right Hippocampus. *p<0.05; r represents the Pearson correlation coefficient.The
      findings above were confirmed by an additional correlation analysis in which
      grade was treated as a continuous predictor across all subjects. The difference
      in activity between addition and multiplication sign-only trials was positively
      correlated with grade in the right hippocampus (r=0.53, p=0.001, pcorr=0.01;
      Fig. 3c). No other significant grade-related changes were found in any other
      regions (all rs<0.38, all ps>0.03, all pscorr>0.30). Bayes Factor analysis indicated
      substantial evidence for this correlation in the right hippocampus (BF10=20.97),
      but no or anecdotal evidence in any other ROIs (all BF10s<2.03). In the right
      hippocampus, the correlation between grade and the contrast of addition sign-only
      trials versus baseline sign-only trials, was also near significance (r=0.33,
      p=0.056; BF10=1.22).2 The correlation between grade and the contrast of multiplication
      sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials, however, was not significant
      (r=0.18, p=0.32; BF10=0.35).3.3. Spatial hippocampal activity in response to
      a + sign relates to an addition-priming effect in children from higher gradesWe
      then tested whether the hippocampal response to a + sign observed in children
      from higher grades was related to the operator-priming effect. To this aim,
      each child performed a version of the operator-priming task outside of the scanner
      (see Fig. 1a).First, we tested whether the results obtained by Fayol and Thevenot
      (2012) in adults (i.e., an operator-priming effect for addition but not for
      multiplication across subjects) could be extended to our children participants.
      Because children from lower grades had a performance close to chance on large
      problems (58%), we exclusively focused our analyses on small problems for which
      accuracy was significantly above chance in all groups (lower grades: 80%, intermediate
      grades: 92%, higher grades: 96%). Planned comparisons revealed an operator-priming
      effect for addition in children from higher grades (1491ms versus 1577ms; F(1,11)=8.11,
      p=0.016), but not in children from lower grades (2289ms versus 2417ms; F(1,10)=2.66,
      p=0.134) and intermediate grades (1530 versus 1509ms; F(1,10)=0.01, p=0.941).
      No operator-priming effect for multiplication was observed in any groups (lower
      grades: F(1,10)=3.50, p=0.091; intermediate grades: F(1,10)=1.52, p=0.246; higher
      grades: F(1,11)=0.14, p=0.715). Bayes Factor analysis indicated substantial
      evidence for an operator-priming effect with addition problems in children from
      higher grades (BF10=4.08), but no evidence in children from intermediate (BF10=0.30)
      and lower (BF10=0.83) grades. There was also no or anecdotal evidence for an
      operator-priming effect with multiplication problems in any group (higher grades:
      BF10=0.31; intermediate grades: BF10=0.55; lower grades: BF10=1.09).Second,
      we tested whether the size of the operator-priming effect in children (measured
      on small problems) was correlated to the magnitude of the response for addition
      sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials in the right hippocampus.
      Such a correlation was found to be highly significant in children from higher
      grades (r=0.82, p=0.0012, Fig. 4), surviving Bonferroni correction for multiple
      comparisons between the two conditions and across the three groups (pcorr=0.007).
      That is, children from higher grades who show greater responses to + signs in
      the right hippocampus are those who show larger operator-priming effect with
      addition problems. No significant correlation was found in children from lower
      (r=0.15, p=0.66 Fig. 4) and intermediate (r=0.24, p=0.48, Fig. 4) grades. Bayes
      Factor analysis indicated substantial evidence for the correlation in children
      from higher grades (BF10=38.15), but no evidence in children from lower (BF10=0.40)
      and intermediate (BF10=0.46) grades. There was also no significant (and anecdotal
      evidence for a) correlation between the operator-priming effect for addition
      problems and the fMRI response to multiplication sign-only trials (compared
      to baseline sign-only trials) in the right hippocampus, in any of the groups
      (lower grades: r=0.06, p=0.87, BF10=0.37; intermediate grades: r=0.32, p=0.34,
      BF10=0.56; higher grades: r=0.51, p=0.09, BF10=1.28). Therefore, not only did
      we observe an operator-priming effect for addition in the only group in which
      we also observed a greater hippocampal response to + than  signs (i.e., children
      from higher grades), but inter-individual differences in the size of the operator-priming
      effect in that group was also related to hippocampal activity.Open in a separate
      windowFig. 4Hippocampus brain-behavior correlation over grade.Activity in the
      right hippocampus in response to addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials as a function of the operator-priming effect calculated in the behavioral
      session for addition problems in children from lower (n=11; grade 3.25.4; mean
      grade=4.4; mean age=9.4), intermediate (n=11; grade 5.66.9; mean grade=6.2;
      mean age=11.1) and higher grades (n=12; grade 7.610.2; mean grade=8.5; mean
      age=13.4). r represents the Pearson correlation coefficient.Third, we tested
      whether the correlation between the operator-priming effect and the contrast
      of addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only trials increased over
      grade. This was done by transforming the correlation coefficient in each group
      to a Fischers z score before comparing the groups using the cocor package (Diedenhofen
      and Musch, 2015). Although the correlation was not greater in children from
      intermediate than lower grades (z=0.19, p=0.43, one-tailed), it was significantly
      greater in children from higher than lower grades (z=2.07, p=0.019, one-tailed)
      and in children from higher than intermediate grades (z=1.88, p=0.030, one-tailed).
      Therefore, this brain-behavior correlation increased over grade.4.DiscussionIn
      the present study, we used fMRI and a cross-sectional design to investigate
      (i) how and when spatial processing related to the perception of an addition
      sign emerges in the developing brain, and (ii) to what extent it contributes
      to the emergence of an operator-priming effect.4.1. The mere perception of a
      + sign is associated with increased hippocampal spatial activity throughout
      age and/or educationIt has been shown that the processing of a + sign is associated
      with the right side of space (Pinhas et al., 2014) and activates brain regions
      involved in overt spatial attention in adults (Mathieu et al., 2017). Therefore,
      we expected arithmetic learning to be associated with increased recruitment
      of brain regions involved in spatial attention in response to the perception
      of a + sign throughout age and/or education in children. This was the case in
      a region of the right hippocampus that we identified in our spatial attention
      localizer task. Therefore, it is possible that hippocampal spatial mechanisms
      may scaffold the progressive association between an arithmetic operator (i.e.,
      a + sign) and spatial intuitions throughout age and/or education. There is increasing
      evidence that the hippocampal formation, and particularly the right hippocampus,
      may house a sense of space (Buffalo, 2015). Specifically, the right hippocampus
      has been extensively reported to support spatial representation and navigation
      in humans (Maguire et al., 1998, Burgess et al., 2002) as well as in non-human
      primates and rodents (O''keefe and Nadel, 1978, Bird and Burgess, 2008). For
      example, the hippocampus is typically activated when human participants learn
      to navigate through a mental representation of space (i.e., mental scanning)
      (Mellet et al., 2002, Spiers and Maguire, 2006). Interestingly, a recent study
      in monkeys demonstrated that neurons in the hippocampal formation may encode
      the direction of overt (Killian et al., 2015) as well as covert (Wilming et
      al., 2015) shifts of attention. Therefore, the hippocampal formation is likely
      a critical region for both representing a mental map of space and navigating
      along that map (Killian et al., 2012, Meister and Buffalo, 2016).Why would such
      a hippocampal spatial navigation mechanism be increasingly recruited by the
      mere perception of a+ sign throughout age and/or education? One possibility
      is that this mechanism might enable children to construct a detailed representation
      of numbers in mental space, as well as to navigate along that mental representation.
      Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence that numbers of increasing size are organized
      along a left-to-right mental map (i.e., the MNL) in adults (Fischer and Shaki
      2014). This spatial representation may enable individuals to add or subtract
      numbers by navigating from a source to a target number to the left or right
      of that MNL. This is supported by behavioral studies showing that addition and
      subtraction problem-solving is associated with rightward and leftward shifts
      of attention (Masson and Pesenti, 2014, Mathieu et al., 2016), as well as by
      a neuroimaging study indicating an overlap between the brain regions involved
      in overt shifts of attention and those involved in arithmetic calculation in
      adults (Knops et al., 2009). Such strategies may be acquired early by children,
      sometimes even explicitly in the classroom where addition and subtraction is
      often demonstrated on visual number lines. Yet, it is only with practice that
      they might become progressively attached to and evoked by an arithmetic operator
      such as a +, which might explain the grade-related increases of activity in
      this region in response to the + sign (and the fact that it is only by 7th grade
      that children exhibit significant activity in response to that sign).4.2. Hippocampal
      spatial activity in response to a + sign relates to the operator-priming effect
      in children from higher gradesA critical question is to what extent this automatic
      processing of a + sign in hippocampal spatial mechanisms is associated with
      childrens behavior. To answer this question, we asked all children to perform
      a version of the operator-priming task developed by Fayol and Thevenot (2012)
      and Roussel et al. (2002). First, we replicated the operator-priming effect
      observed in adults with addition problems (i.e., a facilitation of problem-solving
      when the operator is presented 150ms before the operands), but only in children
      from higher grades (after around 7th grade). Like in adults, this effect was
      specific to addition problems and not observed with multiplication problems.
      Thus, the perception of a + sign (but not that of a  sign) appears to pre-activate
      a process that is likely used to solve the subsequent problem in children from
      higher grades. More central to our current interest, we found that the size
      of the operator-priming effect in these children was highly correlated with
      the degree of activation of hippocampal spatial mechanisms in response to a
      + sign. This indicates that hippocampal spatial activity may be at the source
      of the operator priming-effect in older children, perhaps because these children
      might prepare for an attentional movement along the MNL as soon as a + sign
      is presented. Because no brain-behavior correlation was observed in younger
      children, extensive practice might be needed before such mechanisms are triggered
      by the mere perception of the sign.4.3. Hippocampal spatial activity in response
      to a + sign is transient in developmentStrikingly, the spatial brain mechanisms
      that respond to the mere perception of a + sign appear to be different in children
      and adults. That is, albeit we found increased hippocampal spatial activity
      throughout age and/or education in the present study, we did not identify these
      mechanisms in our previous study in adult participants using the exact same
      task (Mathieu et al., 2017). Rather, we found increased activity in response
      to a + sign in neocortical regions of the FEF and PSPL in adults. Therefore,
      the contribution of the hippocampus to the automatic processing of a + sign
      is likely transient. Such a transient involvement of the hippocampus is consistent
      with a wealth of studies that have demonstrated that the spatial representations
      initially supported by the hippocampus during learning become independent from
      this brain structure over experience and transferred to neocortical regions
      (Rosenbaum et al., 2004, Hirshhorn et al., 2012b). For example, longitudinal
      studies demonstrate that right hippocampal activity associated with learning
      to mentally navigate through a new environment disappears and is replaced by
      neocortical activity when individuals become familiar with that environment
      (Spiers and Maguire, 2007, Hirshhorn et al., 2012a). It is possible that the
      same phenomenon is at play here: The hippocampus may be involved in the early
      representation of (and navigation along) the MNL before that representation
      is transferred to neocortical regions of the fronto-parietal cortex. Future
      investigations with a wider age sample than in the present study are needed
      to test this hypothesis.4.4. Can right hippocampal involvement in the present
      study reflect mnemonic operations involved in learning arithmetic?Although there
      is no doubt that the hippocampus supports spatial processing (Burgess et al.,
      2002, Spiers and Maguire, 2007), this brain structure is also well known to
      support the encoding and consolidation of verbal declarative knowledge into
      long-term memory (Eichenbaum, 2004). In fact, previous developmental studies
      have largely explained the involvement of the hippocampus during arithmetic
      learning by referring to its role in declarative memory rather than spatial
      processing (Rivera et al., 2005, De Smedt et al., 2011, Cho et al., 2011, Cho
      et al., 2012, Qin et al., 2014). This interpretation relies on the claim that
      results of well-practiced arithmetic facts (e.g., 2+3 or 42) might become progressively
      retrieved from memory (rather than calculated) over the course of learning and
      development (Campbell and Xue, 2001). The hippocampus might thus support the
      encoding and consolidation of networks of arithmetic facts in children.Can the
      role of the hippocampus in declarative memory explain the operator-specific
      activity over grade (and correlation with the operator-priming effect) observed
      in the region of the right hippocampus identified by our spatial localizer task?
      We acknowledge that we did not have a task identifying processes involved in
      declarative memory. Thus, even if the right hippocampus is usually more associated
      with spatial than mnemonic processes (Burgess et al., 2002), it is possible
      that the hippocampal cluster that we identified as being involved in spatial
      processing may also be involved in some aspects of declarative memory. One might
      thus argue that grade-related increases of activity in relation to + signs reflect
      the progressive association between a + and a network of additive facts. This
      explanation, however, can be ruled out by an examination of activity related
      to  signs. Because single-digit multiplication problems are almost exclusively
      learned by rote in school, multiplication is the operation that is perhaps the
      most associated with a network of stored facts in the literature (Campbell and
      Xue, 2001). Thus, if increased hippocampal activity in relation to + signs were
      due to the progressive building of a network of additive facts, increased activity
      in that same region should have been observed during the perception of  signs
      (perhaps even more so for the perception of + signs). Yet, this is not the case.
      Not only did we not find any grade-related increase of activity for  signs in
      the hippocampal cluster identified by our spatial localizer task, but activity
      was significantly greater for + than  signs in higher graders (who are as proficient
      in single-digit multiplication as addition). Similarly, no operator-priming
      effect was observed for multiplication problems in higher graders, indicating
      that the operator-priming effect observed for addition is likely to have little
      to do with the pre-activation of a network of stored facts (because this should
      be also observed for multiplication). Therefore, the specificity of our results
      to + signs (as compared to  signs) in the right hippocampus ROI makes it very
      unlikely that our results are related to mnemonic operations. In our view, emerging
      associations between + signs and spatial intuitions related to the MNL are the
      best explanation of the effects reported here.Of course, the fact that the role
      of the hippocampus in declarative memory is unlikely to explain our operator-specific
      findings in the right hippocampus ROI does not mean that hippocampal mechanisms
      supporting mnemonic operations do not contribute to arithmetic learning. Instead,
      they indicate that the hippocampus might contribute to arithmetic learning through
      its role in both declarative memory and spatial processing. Interestingly, the
      operator-specific activity observed in our (spatially localized) right hippocampal
      cluster is not observed in a mirror (left lateralized) cluster that is not activated
      in the localizer contrast (see Supplementary information). In that mirror region,
      no difference was observed between activity related to + and  signs in any group
      of children (and left hippocampal activity was not related to the operator-priming
      effect). Thus, the developmental effect reported here appears to be restricted
      to the right hippocampus. This specificity suggests that the observed developmental
      changes in the right hippocampus may not simply reflect general brain maturation
      but rather mechanisms that are specific to arithmetic learning.4.5. LimitationsIt
      is worth acknowledging here 2 potential limitations of the present work. First,
      as is the case for any cross-sectional fMRI studies, our study is correlational
      in nature. Thus, although our findings are consistent with the idea that the
      right hippocampus might scaffold the progressive association between (at least
      some) arithmetic operators and space throughout age and/or education, future
      studies might specifically investigate the causal role of these hippocampal
      mechanisms. Second, our finding of a correlation between grade and the processing
      of an addition sign in the right hippocampus (see Fig. 3C) relies on a relatively
      large sample size of 34 children. However, other findings involve subgroups
      of participants and therefore rely on smaller sample sizes. In particular, null
      findings in relation to these subgroups might be difficult to interpret because
      of potential lack of power. For example, whereas we found an operator-priming
      effect in children from higher grades and no effect in children from intermediate
      grades, there was no significant difference between these groups in terms of
      response times in negative SOA trials (1491ms versus 1530ms; t21=0.21; p=0.84;
      BF10=0.39). Behavioral studies focusing on the operator-priming effect in children
      might test whether this difference emerges with larger sample sizes. More generally,
      future studies are needed to improve our understanding of the present results.5.ConclusionIn
      sum, our findings suggest that the right hippocampus might contribute to the
      progressive association between (at least some) arithmetic operators and space
      throughout age and/or education. Therefore, our study raises the possibility
      that increased hippocampal activity during arithmetic learning in children may
      be explained by the role of this structure in spatial representations as well
      as in declarative memory.Conflict of interestThe authors declare no competing

      well as Flora Schwartz and the MRI engineers (Franck Lamberton and Danielle
      Ibarrola) at the CERMEP-Lyon platform for their assistance in collecting the
      fMRI data. Finally, we are grateful to Pr. Christian Scheiber for his help with
      the pre-MRI medical exams.Footnotes1Note that to induce an arithmetic context
      and disguise the goal of the experiment, we also included trials in which a
      + or a  sign was followed 150ms later by operands and participants were asked
      to solve the problem. The low temporal resolution of fMRI, however, makes it
      impossible to dissociate activity associated with the sign from activity associated
      with operands in these problems. Therefore, they were simply designed to be
      filler trials.2There was a tendency for a correlation between grade and activity
      associated with addition sign-only trials (versus fixation) in the right hippocampus
      (r=0.29, p=0.09; BF10=0.82), but no correlation for baseline sign-only trials
      (versus fixation) (r=0.10, p=0.58; BF10=0.25). Thus, the correlation between
      grade and the contrast of addition sign-only trials versus baseline sign-only
      trials was more likely driven by changes of activity in addition sign-only trials
      than in baseline sign-only trials.Appendix ASupplementary data associated with

      Significance Statement \n  \nPsychopathic criminals are commonly seen as instrumentally
      abusive and emotionally callous, yet social challenges often trigger uncontrolled
      emotional behavior in those individuals. This study shows how this paradoxical
      aspect of psychopathy relates to altered neuroendocrine interactions between
      testosterone and the cerebral circuit coordinating emotional action tendencies.
      The anterior prefrontal cortex, a region necessary for controlling emotional
      behavior, showed blunted responses and reduced connectivity with the amygdala
      in psychopathic criminals engaged in controlling their emotional action tendencies.
      This cerebral pattern was strongest in psychopathic individuals with high endogenous
      testosterone levels. This neuroendocrine signature of altered emotional control
      highlights the relevance of considering the testosterone level of individual
      psychopathic patients during treatment of their impulsive behavior. \n\n\n##
      Introduction \n  \nPsychopathy is a disorder often associated with blunted emotional
      responding and increased goal-directed behavior ( ;  ). On the other hand, offenders
      with psychopathy also show a paradoxical increase in impulsive behavior and
      uncontrolled aggression after emotional provocations ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), which
      may be related to heightened testosterone levels ( ;  ). These two aspects of
      psychopathy are also distinguished within the most commonly used psychopathy
      checklist, the Psychopathy Check List-Revised (PCL-R), potentially reflecting
      differing traits among psychopathic individuals ( ;  ). Importantly, enhanced
      difficulty in controlling emotional impulses, a crucial component of criminal
      psychopathy associated with PCL-R factor 2, has been largely neglected by cognitive
      neuroscience. Yet, the clinical relevance of this cognitive trait is large:
      reduced behavioral control and increased impulsivity predict recidivism in psychopathic
      offenders ( ), and behavioral control in psychopathic offenders appears particularly
      fragile when dealing with emotionally relevant behavior ( ;  , chapter 7;  ).
      Accordingly, understanding the neurobiological systems underlying the altered
      control of social emotional behavior in psychopathic individuals is relevant
      for improving currently available interventions, which are plagued by low treatment
      response and high recidivism ( ). Here we study those neuroendocrine systems
      in a group of psychopathic offenders engaged in an experimental paradigm that
      requires rule-driven control of emotional behavior. \n\nPrevious investigations
      of psychopathy showed altered reactivity to emotional material in several brain
      regions that include the anterior part of the PFC (aPFC) and the amygdala (
      ;  ;  ). Furthermore, individuals with psychopathy showed decreased functional
      and anatomical connectivity between the PFC and amygdala at rest ( ;  ), an
      indication that these brain regions might have a reduced ability to interact
      effectively. Studies in healthy participants have shown that this cerebral circuit
      is necessary for implementing the control of emotionally relevant actions (
      ). Namely, aPFC downregulates neural processing in the amygdala during emotional
      control ( ), while high levels of endogenous testosterone reduce such control-related
      connectivity between aPFC and amygdala ( ). Those findings raise the possibility
      that aPFCamygdala connectivity is altered when psychopathic offenders need to
      control emotionally relevant actions, with high levels of endogenous testosterone
      exacerbating that altered connectivity. \n\nThis study tests these hypotheses
      by measuring brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      in 15 psychopathic criminals and 19 matched healthy control subjects dealing
      with a challenge to control their emotional behavior. The psychopathy sample
      was obtained by focused and comprehensive screening excluding confounds that
      are frequently associated with random criminal sampling (e.g., medication use,
      comorbidity). The social approachavoidance (AA) task was used to provide reliable
      indexes of control over social emotional behavior ( ;  ;  , ). Behaviorally,
      psychopathic participants previously showed altered AA behavior to explicitly
      approaching and avoiding emotional faces ( ). Similar findings occurred after
      testosterone administration in healthy participants ( ). Interestingly, a more
      subtle version of the AA task has been shown to be sensitive to testosterone-related
      alterations and genetic variations in the aPFCamygdala pathway, while keeping
      behavior constant across experimental groups ( ), opening the way for isolating
      neural vulnerability factors ( ) in psychopathy. During this task, participants
      respond to affective faces (happy, angry) presented for a short time with approach
      and avoidance movements. Automatic emotional tendencies (approachhappy and avoidangry
      faces; affect-congruent response conditions) need to be controlled during affect-incongruent
      response conditions in order to apply the counterintuitive action of approaching
      angry and avoiding happy faces ( ;  ). Healthy participants respond more slowly
      and rely more strongly on the aPFC when emotional control is required, operationalized
      by the differences evoked between affect-incongruent and affect-congruent trials
      ( ;  ). Accordingly, this study tests whether exerting control over emotionally
      relevant actions is reflected by reduced functionality of the aPFCamygdala circuit
      in psychopathic individuals, suggesting less prefrontal regulation of emotional
      actions. In addition, it sets out to test whether this alteration is intensified
      by high levels of endogenous testosterone. \n  \nThe emotional control AA task.
      The AA task involved the presentation of happy and angry faces, and the performance
      of approach and avoidance responses. During the AA task, the participants had
      to select their response according to the perceived emotion of the face. At
      the beginning of each block of 12 trials, the participants received instructions
      on whether to pull the joystick toward themselves (approach) or push it away
      (avoid) when seeing a face with a particular emotion. When viewing happy or
      angry faces, automatic stimulusresponse tendencies trigger corresponding approach
      or avoidance actions. These tendencies could be followed during the affect-congruent
      condition (approachhappy, avoidangry). In contrast, when task instructions required
      participants to avoid happy faces or to approach angry faces, automatic tendencies
      needed to be controlled and overridden with the instructed response (affect-incongruent
      condition). Participants saw the faces and moved the joystick while lying in
      a MR scanner (top left corner of the table). Figure adapted from  ). \n  \n\n##
      Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe psychopathic group was
      recruited from in-patient populations of the Pompestichting and Oldenkotte,
      forensic psychiatric institutes (TBS-clinics) in the Netherlands. TBS-clinics
      are facilities for criminal offenders with a mental disorder treated on behalf
      of the state. \n\nSeventeen male psychopathic violent offenders (age range,
      23-56 years) participated; all had received a diagnosis with a PCL-R score of
      26, according to European standards ( ;  ;  ). PCL-R consensus scores were obtained
      by trained clinicians based on a structured PCL-R interview, clinical status,
      and history. After the independent scoring, the two raters compared their scores
      and came to the consensus score. When no consensus could be found, a third independent
      rater was included in the process. Dutch versions of the National Adult Reading
      Test and Edinburgh Handedness Inventory were used to assess IQ levels and right-handedness
      ( ;  ). Twenty-one healthy male control subjects (HCs) matched for age, right-handedness,
      and IQ, without criminal records or history of psychiatric disorders, were recruited
      from staff of the clinics. All participants received oral and written information
      about the experiment and gave written informed consent according to guidelines
      of the local ethics committee (Commissie Mensengebonden Onderzoek region Arnhem-Nijmegen).
      Psychiatric exclusion criteria consisted of neurological, axis-I, and axis-II
      disorders, besides antisocial personality disorder for the psychopathic group.
      They were screened for these exclusion criteria by trained psychologists using
      Dutch versions of the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID;  ) and Mini-International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI;  ) for   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      of Mental Disorders  , 4th edition, disorders. All participants were asked about
      drug use and medical/neurological history to exclude the following: alcohol
      use of >3 units/day, cannabis, or other illicit drug use 1 week before, psychotropic
      medication other than oxazepam 5 d before, 1 unit of alcohol or oxazepam use
      within 24 h before the experiment; history of trauma capitis; visual and auditive
      disorder; and neurological disorder. Furthermore, general exclusion criteria
      for MRI experiments were applied. Two psychopathic patients (PPs) and two HCs
      were excluded from the analyses, due to incomplete scanning procedures (1 PP,
      1 HC) or too many errors on the task (>16%, representing the outlier with a   z  -score
      >3). The final groups did not differ in age, IQ, and handedness (see  ). \n  \nDemographical
      data \n    \n\n### Procedure \n  \nTwo test sessions took place. During the
      first session, right-handedness, IQ, MINI, and SCID were assessed. During the
      second session, participants completed several questionnaires upon arrival in
      the laboratory, including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to measure
      anxiety levels ( ). Next, they provided saliva for the testosterone measurement.
      Afterward, participants were positioned in the 1.5 T MR scanner and familiarized
      with the task setup. Immediately after this, the fMRI session started with the
      AA task (duration, 30 min) followed by another task (not included in this report).
      After a short break outside the scanner, the anatomical scan (duration, 5 min)
      and an unrelated task were acquired in the side-by-side 3 T MR scanner. \n\n\n###
      Experimental task \n  \nThe AA task consisted of 24 blocks (with 12 trials per
      block and a baseline period of 21-24 s) during which participants had to respond
      to visually presented faces either by pulling a joystick toward themselves (approach)
      or by pushing it away from themselves (avoid;  ). The participants had to categorize
      faces as happy, angry, and neutral (filler items), based on their affective
      expressions. During each block, two of the three affective expressions were
      presented as stimuli, because only two responses could be given to categorize
      the stimulus. This resulted in six different block types each used four times,
      representing the affect (happyangry, happyneutral, angryneutral)  movement (approachavoid)
      combinations. At the start of each block, participants received written instructions
      regarding the required response mapping. The affect  movement combinations were
      pseudorandomly and evenly distributed (with no affect combination repetition),
      and the combination of the first block was counterbalanced across participants.
      Within each block, affective expressions and gender types were pseudorandomly
      presented, avoiding three or more sequential presentations of the same expression/gender,
      and two presentations of the same facial model. Each face was presented for
      100 ms, preceded by a 300 ms blank screen, and followed by the participants
      response, a blank screen, and by a pseudorandom intertrial interval (ITI; 1-3
      s). A baseline period of 21-24 s preceded each block. The faces were from 36
      models (18 male) obtained from several databases ( ;  ;  ; ), each showing all
      expressions. The pictures were in grayscale, matched for brightness and contrast
      values, and displayed against a black background. To exclude influence from
      hair and nonfacial contours, the faces were trimmed. Joystick displacements
      of >80% along the sagittal plane within 2 s from stimulus presentation were
      marked as valid responses. Invalid responses were signaled for 1 s with written
      feedback stating you did not move your joystick far enough. After moving the
      joystick, participants had to return to the starting position (defined as the
      central area extending 20% along the sagittal plane) before the end of the ITI.
      Otherwise, visual feedback indicated return the joystick to the starting position,
      and the ITI was repeated after participants returned the joystick. The training
      at the beginning consisted of six blocks; one block of eight trials for each
      of the six affect  movement combinations. Different visual stimuli were used
      during the training and scanning blocks. \n\n\n### Materials and apparatus \n  \nThe
      fMR images were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner (Avanto, Siemens Medical Systems)
      with an eight-channel head coil using a multiecho generalized autocalibrating
      partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) sequence [ ; repetition time (TR),
      2.14 ms; five echo times (TEs), 9.4/21/33/44/56 ms; 34 transversal slices; ascending
      acquisition; distance factor, 17%; effective voxel size, 3.3  3.3  3.5 mm; field
      of view (FOV), 212 mm]. High-resolution anatomical images were acquired on a
      3 T MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil using a magnetization prepared rapid
      gradient echo sequence (TR, 2300 ms; TE, 3.03 ms; 192 sagittal slices; voxel
      size, 1.0  1.0  1.0 mm; FOV, 256 mm). \n\nAn MR-compatible joystick (Fiber Optic
      Joystick, Current Designs; sampling rate, 550 Hz) was placed on participants
      abdomens to ensure comfortable push-and-pull movements ( ). Participants wore
      MR-compatible headphones to reduce scanner noise (Commander XG MRI Audio System,
      Resonance Technologies). Stimuli were projected at the center of a screen, viewed
      via a mirror above the participants head, with a visual angle of 4  6 (width  height).
      Stimuli presentation and acquisition of joystick positions were controlled by
      a PC running Presentation version 13 ( ). \n\n\n### Salivary measurements \n  \nParticipants
      filled two Salicaps (IBL) with saliva for testosterone measurement, which were
      stored at 25C. Testosterone concentration was measured using competitive chemiluminescence
      immunoassay with a sensitivity of 0.0025 ng/ml (IBL International, Tecan). Intra-assay
      and interassay coefficients are between 10% and 12%. To control variables influencing
      testosterone levels, participants were instructed to refrain from any food,
      cigarettes, and drinks (except water) for 1 h before the experiment. \n\n\n###
      Behavioral analysis \n  \nBehavioral data was analyzed using MATLAB version
      7.9 (MathWorks) and PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc.). First, to obtain a precise
      measure of movement onset [reaction time (RT)], the joystick movement for each
      trial was reconstructed using the joystick displacement measurements. Excluded
      trials showed a joystick movement in the wrong direction, an extreme RT (<150
      or >1500 ms), peak velocity (<0.1 cm/s), or movement time (>400 ms); or an error
      rate of above chance level in a block (in that case, the whole block was excluded).
      RTs and testosterone levels were log transformed to obtain a normal distribution.
      Second, following previous studies ( ;  ), we conducted three-way repeated-measures
      ANOVA (ANCOVArm) on the mean RT and error rates, with factors group (PP, HC),
      movement (approach, avoid), and valence (happy, angry), including standardized
      testosterone and STAI state as covariate. A measure of anxiety (STAI) was included
      to account for the effects of psychopathy type (e.g., primary vs secondary);
      and the possible effects on emotional behavior, hormonal levels, amygdala, and
      prefrontal cortex functioning ( ;  ;  ; ). The -level was set at   p   < 0.05.
      \n\n\n### Functional MRI data \n  \n#### Single-subject analyses \n  \nImaging
      data were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping;  ).
      The first four volumes of each participants dataset were discarded to allow
      for   T   equilibration. Given the multiecho GRAPPA MR sequence (Poser et al.,
      2006), head motion parameters were estimated on MR images with the shortest
      TE (9.4 ms), since these are least affected by possible artifacts. These motion
      correction parameters, estimated using a least-squares approach with six rigid
      body transformation parameters (translations, rotations), were applied to the
      five echo images collected for each excitation. After spatial realignment, the
      five echo images were combined into a single MR volume using an optimized echo
      weighting method (Poser et al., 2006). The time series for each voxel was temporally
      realigned to the first slice in time. The   T  -weighted image was spatially
      coregistered to the mean of the functional images. The fMRI time series were
      transformed and resampled at an isotropic voxel size of 2 mm into standard Montreal
      Neurological Institute (MNI) space by unified segmentation and normalization
      using the coregistered   T  -weighted image ( ). The normalized functional images
      were spatially smoothed using an isotropic 8 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian
      kernel. \n\nThe fMRI time series of each subject were further analyzed using
      an event-related approach in the context of general linear model, including
      the following effects: approachhappy, approachneutral, approachangry, avoidhappy,
      avoidneutral, and avoidangry. Trials excluded from behavioral analyses and periods
      of instructions or feedback were modeled as regressors. Vectors describing the
      time of picture presentation (onset) and RT of each event (duration) were convolved
      with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Potential confounding effects
      of residual head movement were modeled using original, squared, cubic, first-order,
      and second-order derivatives of the movement correction parameters ( ). Three
      further regressors, describing the time course of signal intensities of white
      matter, CSF, and the portion of the MR image outside the skull were also added.
      This procedure accounts for image intensity shifts due to hand movements within
      or near the magnetic field of the scanner ( ). Finally, fMRI time series were
      high-pass filtered (cutoff 120 s). Temporal autocorrelation was modeled as a
      first-order autoregressive process. \n\n\n#### Group analyses \n  \nConsistent
      effects across participants and between groups were tested using a random-effects
      multiple regression analysis that included six contrast images (approachhappy,
      approachneutral, approachangry, avoidhappy, avoidneutral, avoidangry) per participant.
      Together, these images represented the estimated cerebral effects from 12 conditions
      of the experimental design [group (PP, HC)  valence (happy, neutral, angry)  response
      (approach, avoid)]. Standardized log-transformed testosterone and standardized
      STAI state levels were included in the multiple regression analysis as condition-specific
      [group (PP, HC)  valence (happy, neutral, angry)  response (approach, avoid)]
      regressors, generating another 12 regressors per variable. \n\nAll analyses
      assessed the congruency effect, reflecting task-related differences of affect-incongruent
      (approachangry, avoidhappy) versus affect-congruent trials (approachhappy, avoidangry;  ;  ).
      We considered two effects. First, to test for general effects of congruency,
      we performed an analysis on the congruency effect over both groups and for each
      group separately. When assessing the effects of one group explicitly, we also
      tested whether those effects were specific to that group and were significantly
      weaker in the other group (at   p   < 0.05 uncorrected) by masking the statistical
      map describing the congruency effect in the first group (using multiple comparisons
      correction, see below) with the statistical map describing the group  congruency
      contrast. Second, to test whether testosterone differentially modulated the
      control of emotionally relevant actions in the groups, we performed a group  congruency
      contrast on the regressor parametrizing interindividual differences in testosterone
      on task-related conditions. If such an interaction is present, the testosterone
      modulation on the congruency effect of each group separately is considered.
      In addition to whole-brain analyses, we used a volume of interest (VOI) on coordinates
      previously found to be modulated by testosterone during the congruency effect
      in healthy students (two 8-mm-radius spheres centered on the following MNI coordinates:   x  ,
      30;   y  , 58; and z, 2; and   x  , 32;   y  , 54; and   z  , 8;  ). \n\nThe
      reported activations are corrected for multiple comparisons using familywise
      error (FWE) correction. For whole-brain analyses, we made inferences at cluster
      level (FWE:   p   < 0.05, corresponding to a cluster size of >140 on the basis
      of intensity threshold,   p   < 0.001). For VOI analyses, we made inferences
      at voxel-level (FWE corrected,   p   < 0.05;  ;  ). Anatomical inference is
      drawn by superimposing SPM showing significant signal changes on structural
      images of participants. For anatomical accuracy, we report only activation peaks
      in gray matter. Anatomical landmarks were identified using the atlas of  . Brodmann
      areas (BAs) were assigned by superimposing significant SPM on the SPM anatomy
      toolbox ( ) and MRIcron template ( /). \n\n\n\n### Connectivity analyses \n  \nThe
      aim of the following analysis was to test whether inter-regional coupling of
      the aPFC (see Results) with the amygdala and other brain regions during the
      congruency effect was different between the groups and modulated by testosterone.
      To test for these effects, we used the psychophysiological interactions (PPIs)
      method ( ). More specifically, we tested for significant differences between
      the regression coefficients of each voxel over the right aPFC during the affect-incongruent
      versus the affect-congruent conditions. To select voxels to be included in the
      VOI, we used the following anatomical constraints ( ): for each participant,
      selected voxels fell within a sphere with a radius of 4 mm around the peak voxel
      corresponding to the activated cluster of the congruency effect over both groups
      (coordinates:   x  , 30;   y  , 58;   z  , 14; see Results). Participant specific
      contrast images were generated describing the PPI between the time courses of
      the right aPFC VOI and affect-incongruent versus affect-congruent conditions.
      Group differences and testosterone modulations on task-related coupling between
      the aPFC and other regions were then assessed using a multiple regression design
      on participant-specific contrast images with their corresponding testosterone
      (log-transformed, standardized) and STAI state (standardized) levels as subject-
      and group-specific regressors. In addition to whole-brain analyses, we assessed
      significant voxel-level effects (FWE corrected for multiple comparisons,   p   <
      0.05) within the amygdala, defined on the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas
      ( ) using the WFU PickAtlas tool ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral
      results \n  \nFifteen psychopathic criminals (PPs; PCL-R score of 26, according
      to European standards ( ;  ;  ) and 19 HCs (for demographics, see  ) were included
      in the analyses. Participants performed the task accurately and consistently
      (error rates: PPs, 7.9%; HCs, 7.3%; omissions: PPs, 1.6%; HCs, 1.5%; undefined
      responses: PPs, 0.9%; HCs, 0.3%;  ). \n  \nRTs and error rates for each group
      and factor of the AA task \n    \nA significant movement  valence interaction
      for the RTs indicated that, over groups, participants responded more slowly
      during affect-incongruent (approachangry, avoidhappy) than during affect-congruent
      trials (approachhappy, avoidangry;   F   = 10.4,   p   = 0.003;  ). This congruency
      effect replicates the behavioral results from previous fMRI studies ( ;  ).
      Furthermore, there were main effects of movement (  F   = 26.3,   p   < 0.001)
      and valence (  F   = 28.7,   p   < 0.001), reflecting the slowing of avoidance
      movements and responses to angry faces in general ( ). There were no significant
      effects involving group, including no main effect (  p   > 0.3). The congruency
      effect correlated positively (without corrections for multiple comparisons)
      with the PCL-R total score (  p   = 0.048,   R   = 0.517, respectively). Excluding
      anxiety from the analyses did not affect the outcomes. Moreover, when including
      the neutral conditions in the analyses, the movement  valence (happy, neutral,
      angry) interaction for RTs remained significant (  F   = 5.5,   p   = 0.010),
      showing that neutral approachavoidance effects are intermediary compared with
      happy and angry ( ). \n  \nBehavioral results. Mean RTs (SEM) for the affect-congruent
      and affect-incongruent conditions of the AA task for the healthy control subjects
      and psychopathic offenders. The groups were significantly slower to provide
      affect-incongruent responses (approachangry; avoidhappy) than affect-congruent
      responses (approachhappy; avoidangry), with no significant group differences.
      \n  \nFor the error rates, the three-way ANCOVArm showed main effects of movement
      (  F   = 27.5,   p   < 0.001), valence (  F   = 25.9,   p   < 0.001), and testosterone
      (  F   = 4.6,   p   = 0.040), and a valence  testosterone interaction (  F   =
      4.3,   p   = 0.047). There were no other significant effects for the error rates
      (  p   > 0.15). \n\nEndogenous testosterone levels [median (SD): PPs, 101 pg/ml
      (70 pg/ml); HCs, 90 pg/ml (46 pg/ml)] and state anxiety levels [STAI mean (SD):
      PPs, 32 (8); HCs, 32 (5)] did not differ between groups (  p   > 0.4), and showed
      no correlations with psychopathy (PCL-R) scores or with each other (  p   >
      0.1). \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### Multiple regression analyses \n  \nTo
      assess the two main questions of this study, we isolated cerebral structures
      showing stronger responses during affect-incongruent than affect-congruent trials
      (congruency effect), and cerebral structures in which the congruency effect
      was modulated by testosterone levels. \n\nThe results showed a significant congruency
      effect across groups in the aPFC [ROI analysis: MNI coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ):
      (30, 58, 14) and (30 58 10);   p   = 0.001 and 0.036;   t   = 4.46 and 3.43;
      for further details, see  ]. As expected, this effect was driven by the healthy
      control group, and it was significantly weaker in the psychopathic offenders
      [  p   = 0.001 and 0.040;   t   = 4.58 and 3.40, on the congruency effect in
      healthy control subjects masked implicitly by group (HC > PP)  congruency interaction].
      The implicit masking demonstrates that the group  congruency interaction is
      also significant at   p   < 0.05 within the significant voxels corrected for
      multiple comparisons on the HC congruency effect. The psychopathy group showed
      no significant congruency effect in this region (  p   > 0.3). There was also
      a significant congruency effect across groups in the right superior parietal
      lobule (whole-brain analysis); this effect was driven mainly by the psychopathy
      group ( ). \n  \nClusters showing significantly larger activity for the affect-incongruent
      vs the affect-congruent conditions (emotion-control effect) \n    \nCritically,
      testosterone modulated the congruency effect in the aPFC differently in psychopathic
      offenders and healthy control subjects (whole-brain analysis on testosterone  group  congruency:
      MINI coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ): (30, 58, 12);   p   < 0.001;   t   =
      5.10; for all details, see  ).   Post hoc   analyses revealed that, in the psychopathy
      group, congruency effects decreased as testosterone levels increased [MNI coordinates
      (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ): (32, 56, 10) and (30, 58, 8);   p   = 0.002 and 0.015;   t   =
      4.34 and 3.74]. The modulatory effect of testosterone on congruency was absent
      in the healthy control subjects (  p    0.05;  ). The whole-brain analysis also
      showed an effect in the right caudate nucleus and right inferior supramarginal
      gyrus, driven by reduced congruency effects as a function of testosterone in
      the psychopathy group ( ;  ). \n  \nTestosterone modulations of the cerebral

      purposes. There are no outliers [Mahalanobis distances   D     < 4.2 (cutoff
      at   p   < 0.05;   D   = 7.74);  ;  ]. Healthy control subjects show an increased
      aPFC activity for the congruency effect and no modulation by testosterone, while
      in psychopathic offenders endogenous testosterone levels modulate the activity
      of the aPFC and right supramarginal gyrus. \n  \n\n#### Effective connectivity
      analyses \n  \nGiven the relevance of aPFCamygdala connectivity for implementing
      emotional control as evoked by the AA task ( ), we assessed whether psychopathy
      also resulted in altered connectivity along that neural pathway. Connectivity
      analyses using the right aPFC [4-mm-radius sphere; central voxel from main analysis
      (MNI coordinates:   x  , 30;   y  , 58;   z  , 14)] as the seed region on the
      congruency effect indicated a significant group difference (PP > HC) with the
      right amygdala ( ; ROI analysis; extent, 3 voxels;   t   = 3.82;   p   = 0.027;
      MNI coordinates of local maxima:   x  , 32;   y  , 0;   z  , 16). When testing
      effects for both groups separately, healthy control subjects showed a significant
      negative coupling between the right aPFC and amygdala (ROI analysis; extent:
      3 voxels,   t   = 3.70;   p   = 0.036; MNI coordinates of local maxima:   x  ,
      32;   y  , 0;   z  , 16), while psychopathic offenders showed no differential
      connectivity effect.   Post hoc   testing on right amygdala voxels showing the
      group interaction (threshold,   p   < 0.05 FWE) indicated a significant positive
      correlation with testosterone over both groups (ROI analysis; extent, 1 voxel;   t   =
      2.29;   p   = 0.029; MNI coordinates of local maxima:   x  , 32;   y  , 2;   z  ,
      16). There was no correlation between aPFCamygdala connectivity and the PCL-R
      scores (  p   > 0.2). \n  \nGroup difference on congruency-related aPFCamygdala

      control subjects, which is not present in the psychopathic offenders. \n  \n\n\n\n##
      Discussion \n  \nThis study indicates that psychopathic offenders show reduced
      aPFC activity as well as less aPFCamygdala connectivity during the control of
      emotional behavior. Emotional control was measured by comparing affect-incongruent
      and affect-congruent approachavoidance responses to emotional faces (congruency
      effect on the AA task;  ). When healthy control subjects exerted emotional control,
      reaction times, aPFC activity, and aPFCamygdala anticorrelations increased,
      confirming previous observations ( ). In contrast, psychopathic offenders did
      not show this typical control-related pattern of aPFC activity and connectivity.
      In addition, these effects were significantly modulated by endogenous testosterone.
      Namely, psychopathic individuals with relatively lower testosterone levels showed
      a neural activity and connectivity pattern that resembled the findings in healthy
      control subjects, while this pattern was absent in those with higher testosterone
      levels. This indicates that especially psychopathic individuals with high testosterone
      levels have less prefrontal regulation of amygdala-driven emotional actions
      when the control of emotional behavior is required. \n\n### Emotional control
      in psychopathy \n  \nImaging studies have illustrated an association between
      psychopathy and altered processing of fear, including altered amygdala responses
      ( ;  ;  ), attentional deficits for peripheral stimuli ( ), and moral/empathic
      insensitivity ( ;  ). However, psychopathic offenders also show clear impulsivity
      problems ( ), for example, when control is required during emotionally provoking
      situations. To address this relatively unexplored but crucial component of criminal
      psychopathy, we used a paradigm requiring rule-driven control of emotional actions.
      With this paradigm, it was possible to move beyond simple motor inhibition and
      to target the flexible control of emotionally driven action tendencies. \n\nFirst,
      the aPFC (also called BA 10) was less active in psychopathic offenders as a
      function of testosterone. The aPFC is a region crucial for the control of social
      emotional behavior. When aPFC functioning is temporarily disrupted, participants
      have increased difficulty in overriding emotional tendencies with rule-driven
      behavior ( ). Moreover, the aPFC seems especially important for integrating
      and coordinating multiple cognitive processes to facilitate response selection
      ( ;  ). For example, transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced reduction of
      aPFC functioning during the control of emotional behavior decreased activity
      in brain areas associated with rule selection (posterior parietal cortex), while
      both amygdala activity and automatic action tendencies increased ( ). The current
      study indicates that psychopathic individuals with especially high testosterone
      levels recruited the aPFC less when the control of emotional responses was needed.
      This finding suggests that they have reduced coordination of rule-based behavior
      with emotional information. \n\nSecond, connectivity between the aPFC and amygdala
      also differed significantly between groups. Healthy control subjects showed
      a negative aPFCamygdala coupling during the control of social emotional behavior,
      whereas psychopathic individuals showed no significant coupling between these
      regions. Evidence of anatomical connectivity alterations between these regions
      in psychopathic individuals and the relation of that tract to social emotional
      behavior modifications support these findings ( ). Although these results cannot
      resolve the direction of these connectivity effects, a previous study ( ) using
      this paradigm showed an effective connectivity modulation of emotional control
      on the connection from aPFC to amygdala. Also, animal studies ( ) suggest strong
      prefrontal inhibitory connections that control automatic amygdala responses.
      The absence of this aPFCamygdala coupling in psychopathic offenders suggests
      that in this group the aPFC has a reduced ability to inhibit amygdala-driven
      responses. This study used subtle emotional provocations, but stronger emotional
      events result in stronger amygdala responses, increasing the bias for automatic
      emotional behavior ( ). A lack of prefrontal control likely reduces the ability
      to inhibit these biases and lead to an increased expression of automatic emotional
      actions even when they are not beneficial ( ;  ). \n\nTestosterone administration
      studies also illustrated a decoupling between the prefrontal cortex and the
      amygdala, suggesting that testosterone reduces the communication between the
      PFC and amygdala ( ;  ;  ) and, within the AA task, reduces top-down control.
      The association between testosterone levels and enhanced social aggression and
      dominance seeking, and reduced impulse control in the general population ( ;  ;  )
      supports the relevance of testosterone in this process. Even amygdala responses
      to angry faces have recently been found to be enhanced after testosterone administration
      and in psychopathic individuals ( ;  ;  ). There is a clear association between
      testosterone and aggression after provocation, which has been related to reduced
      activity in the orbital frontal cortex, a region just ventral of the aPFC (
      ). Interestingly, psychopathic offenders with lower testosterone levels displayed
      a pattern similar to that in healthy control subjects, while the psychopathic
      individuals with high testosterone levels showed less aPFC activity and aPFCamygdala
      coupling. This could provide a potential vulnerability factor explaining the
      difference between the goal-directed successful psychopath and the unsuccessful
      psychopath with reduced impulse control ( ;  ). We hypothesize that especially
      psychopathic individuals with high testosterone levels fail to inhibit amygdala-driven
      action tendencies using the aPFC during the control of emotional behavior.\n
      \n\nEndogenous testosterone levels also modulated control-related activity in
      the supramarginal gyrus and caudate nucleus of the psychopathy group. The supramarginal
      gyrus was previously found to be involved during emotional control on the AA
      task in a healthy student sample ( ). Previous work indicated that it plays
      an important role in action organization ( ), and that psychopathic individuals
      show reduced supramarginal gyrus activity compared with control subjects when
      reasoning about other peoples emotional state ( ). The current findings, emphasizing
      the role of supramarginal gyrus during emotional control in psychopathic offenders
      with low testosterone levels, could indicate the facilitation of action preparation
      in trials with affect-incongruent stimulusresponse mapping. The caudate nucleus
      is important for incorporating predicted action outcome, when selecting the
      most beneficial behavioral goal ( ), and has previously found to be larger in
      psychopathy ( ). In light of these findings, our results suggest that psychopathic
      offenders with low endogenous testosterone levels, as opposed to those with
      high testosterone levels, have more interference of automatic action tendencies
      and outcomes associated with the facial emotions (e.g., approachhappy) that
      are opposite to the required actions during affect-incongruent trials ( ). \n\n\n###
      Interpretational issues \n  \nIndividuals with psychopathy have been suggested
      to have difficulty recognizing emotional expressions. However, this impairment
      seems quite specific to fear, rather than the emotional expressions used here
      (anger and happiness;  ;  ). Furthermore, the groups assessed in this study
      made comparable numbers of errors, suggesting that psychopathic offenders had
      no special difficulty in recognizing the clear emotional expressions used in
      this study. \n\nThis study used a relatively subtle manipulation to target the
      emotional control system. The rationale of this choice was to detect neural
      vulnerability markers without affecting behavioral performance. Psychopathic
      offenders performing a more salient behavioral version of the AA task showed
      reduced avoidance of angry faces ( ). In this study, angry faces evoked numerically
      similar behavioral effects ( ) and, additionally, aPFC effects (  post hoc   inspection
      of extracted parameters). Although these observations could be interpreted as
      a sign that psychopathic offenders have a tendency to approach angry faces,
      those observations were not statistically significant between groups [behavioral
      and aPFC group effects on angry faces:   p   > 0.2;   p   = 0.271;   z   = 2.54,
      on the angrycongruency effect in healthy control subjects masked implicitly
      by group (HC > PP)  angrycongruency interaction]. Future investigation is needed
      to directly test whether more provocative paradigms induce specific effects
      for angry faces. A previous study ( ) using this fMRI task in participants with
      genetic susceptibility for developing aggressive disorders, also found no group-specific
      behavioral effects. That study suggested that alterations of the aPFCamygdala
      pathway might reflect a vulnerability factor for psychopathologies. \n\nPreviously,
      endogenous testosterone modulated the aPFC and aPFCamygdala coupling in a sample
      of healthy students ( ). In that study, a different demographic group of healthy
      control subjects similarly showed a testosterone modulation of aPFCamygdala
      coupling, but no testosterone modulation of aPFC activity. This difference in
      the strength of testosterone-modulatory effects might be related to between-group
      differences in age (mean healthy control subjects, 41; mean students, 22;  ),
      educational level (staff of forensic psychiatric institute vs university students),
      or general anxiety [STAI trait, lower in healthy control subjects of the current
      study; mean (SD): 29 (4.4) and 34 (6.9), respectively;   t   = 2.605;   p   =
      0.014]. A limitation of this study is the modest sample size. Our focus to exclude
      moderating factors of comorbid disorders (except antisocial personality disorder)
      and recent drug use has the advantage that the sample is relatively homogeneous,
      but future studies using larger samples are needed for replication and to define
      subsamples. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nPsychopathic offenders showed reduced
      aPFC activity and aPFCamygdala connectivity during control of emotional actions,
      suggesting a decreased coordination of emotional information during rule-driven
      behavior. Moreover, endogenous testosterone modulated the involvement of these
      neural mechanisms. Psychopathic offenders with high testosterone levels showed
      less involvement of the aPFC, aPFCamygdala connectivity, supramarginal gyrus,
      and caudate nucleus, whereas psychopathic individuals with low testosterone
      levels recruited the aPFC in a fashion similar to that of healthy control subjects.
      These findings suggest that a lack of prefrontal control during emotional actions
      may explain enhanced impulsivity in psychopathic offenders during emotionally
      provoking situations. They outline a neuroendocrine model underlying impulsive
      emotional behavior in psychopathy and support the relevance of assessing a potential
      imbalance in testosterone function to guide treatment. It remains to be seen
      whether these neuroendocrine alterations of emotional control are also present
      in highly impulsive or antisocial individuals. \n\n\n \n\n Call the extractData
