However, the neural correlates of allocentric thinking in communicative signaling remain unclear. We adapted a novel signaling task in which the signaler was given the target word and must choose a one-word signal to help the receiver guess the target. Behavioral results suggest that speakers can use allocentric thinking to choose signals that are salient from the perspective of the receiver rather than their own point of view. At the neural level, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data reveal that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ventral striatum, and temporal-parietal junction are more activated when signalers engage in allocentric than egocentric thinking. Moreover, functional connectivity between the mPFC and ventral striatum predicted individuals’ perspective-taking ability during successful communication. These findings reveal that neural representations in the mPFC-striatum network support perspective-taking in complex social decision making, providing a new perspective on how the brain arbitrates between allocentric thinking and egocentric thinking in communication and social coordination.Previous article in issueNext article in issueKeywordsCommunicationPerspective-takingAllocentric thinkingWord associationForward and backward salienceSignalingfMRI1. IntroductionCommunicating successfully with another agent requires the ability to take that person's perspective into account, so as to decide how to choose the most effective cues to send and how to correctly interpret signals received. The perspective-taking ability to know what others know (and, hence, what is mutually known) plays a fundamental role in message formulation and comprehension (Clark, 1985; Clark and Marshall, 1981; Glucksberg and Krauss, 1967; Krauss and Fussell, 1991; Ritter, 1979; Rosenberg and Cohen, 1964). Grice (1975) proposed that conversational inferences are made possible by implicit agreements between speakers and listeners. In the Gricean cooperative principle, speakers’ utterances have to deliver the most relevant information on the topic of discussion in order to reduce the potential interference in the listeners’ inferential processes (Grice, 1957, 1969; Grice, 1975). Namely, when speakers choose a particular word, they should adopt the perspective of their conversational partner to reduce referential ambiguity (Sperber and Wilson, 1995). Following Grice's initial framework, a Rational Speech Act theory further posited that rational speakers should maximize the social utility of providing epistemic help to a listener (Goodman and Frank, 2016). This is especially true when a particular event or object is being denoted during a conversation, a process called referential communication (Glucksberg et al., 1975; Krauss and Fussell, 1991; Wardlow, 2013).During referential communication, the signaler has a target meaning to convey and needs to send a signal that represents that meaning. The receiver, on the other hand, must infer the target meaning from the signal. A block to successful communication can happen as a signal that is salient/informative to the signaler is not necessarily so to the receiver, and vice versa (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). For example, the signaler may associate the target ‘bank’ with cue ‘money’ (a salient feature of the bank), but sending a signal representing ‘money’ may not help the receiver to guess the word ‘bank’ because ‘bank’ is not a salient feature of ‘money’. Instead, to communicate adequately, the signaler may send a signal representing ‘teller’ to help the receiver think of ‘bank’, even when the signaler may not strongly associate ‘bank’ with ‘teller’ (Nelson et al., 2004; Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). The knowledge of the patterns of salience between words provides a common ground between parties to communicate effectively without prior interactions with each other (Clark, 1996; Levinson, 2006; Lewis, 1969; Nelson et al., 2004; Rosenberg and Cohen, 1964; Ryskin et al., 2015; Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). Effective communication requires individuals to use common ground information and to suppress the tendency to use private information (Bögels et al., 2015). Lewis (1969) posited a game-theoretic account of coordination indicating that salient aspects of world knowledge allow people to coordinate in the absence of convention. For example, the speakers might utter a word that is strongly connected with the referent to assist listeners in narrowing the possible referents that they will infer after hearing that word. Although several theories have proposed that the use of perspective-taking (e.g., inhibit egocentric perspective and adopt allocentric perspective) boots successful communication between two persons (e.g., Clark and Murphy, 1982; Grice, 1975; Levinson, 2006; Sperber and Wilson, 1995), empirical evidence regarding how people flexibly switch their perspectives (i.e., egocentric vs. allocentric) in word selection during communicative coordination is still lacking. Moreover, the neural basis of how speakers coordinate their communicative goal with others by taking the perspective of the person receiving the signal remains not well understood.A variety of referential communication tasks have been implemented to study the extent to which listeners are able to interpret the meaning of the signal by inferring others’ intention and belief (also known as mentalizing) (Apperly et al., 2010; Barr, 2008; Dumontheil et al., 2010a; Frank and Goodman, 2012; Hanna et al., 2003; Keysar et al., 2000, 2003; Krauss and Glucksberg, 1977; Sidera et al., 2018). A widely-used task in this area is the director task in which a director gives instructions to move objects around in a grid, some of which are only seen by the participants (listeners) but not by the director (Keysar et al., 2000). In order to be successful in selecting the target object, listeners need to correctly infer which objects are invisible from the speakers’ perspective and inhibit their own perspective accordingly. Researchers using this task showed that listeners were biased to their own egocentric perspective, i.e., participants looked longer at and reached more for an object which was only visible to themselves than the one observed by both parties (Apperly et al., 2010; Keysar, 2007, 2003; Lin et al., 2010). Neuroimaging studies with this task found activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and middle temporal gyri (MTG) when participants were required to take into account the perspective of the director (Dumontheil et al., 2010b; Hillebrandt et al., 2013). The mPFC is involved in the mentalizing network (Molenberghs et al., 2016; Schurz et al., 2014), while MTG is related to the recognition of faces (Acheson and Hagoort, 2013; Singer et al., 2004). Another study also found that adolescents who were better in social perspective-taking usage during the director task had thinner cerebral cortex in the regions of middle frontal gyrus and the lateral parietal lobe (Tamnes et al., 2018), suggesting that frontal-parietal regions account for individual difference in perspective-taking. However, this line of research mainly focused on how individuals interpret others’ instructions in order to navigate the visual world. Whether and how individuals spontaneously choose signals that help listeners to better decode the signal correctly and effectively remains unclear.The mPFC and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) have been implicated repeatedly in mentalizing tasks which often involve the prediction of what the other person might think or feel in hypothetical situations using story vignettes and cartoons (Aichhorn et al., 2006; Castelli et al., 2000; Molenberghs et al., 2016; Schurz et al., 2014). These regions are also found to differentiate different aspects of mental states during cooperation versus competition in social games (Tsoi et al., 2016). In addition, neuroimaging studies using social interactive games that require iterative reasoning about people's minds, such as the Beauty Contest game (Coricelli and Nagel, 2009), Patent Race game (Zhu et al., 2012), and Stag Hunt game (Yoshida et al., 2010), also found that the mPFC is involved in the inferential processes during strategic reasoning. The mPFC has been shown to dissociate between subjects with different levels (i.e., high versus low) of strategic reasoning in the Beauty Contest game, suggesting that mPFC implements more high-level strategic thinking when inferring other players’ thoughts (Coricelli and Nagel, 2009).In addition to these key mentalizing regions, the striatum is also implicated in strategic thinking in social contexts. The striatum has long been shown to encode reward prediction error signals in reinforcement learning tasks (Daniel and Pollmann, 2014; Garrison et al., 2013; Liljeholm and O'Doherty, 2012), such as representing and resolving the mismatch between expected rewards and actual outcomes (Garrison et al., 2013; Pagnoni et al., 2002). In social tasks, striatal activation has also been observed in social learning and implicated in social prediction error and belief updating (Behrens et al., 2008; Hampton et al., 2008; Hertz et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2012). There is evidence that the frontostriatal circuit is a part of the neural architecture which facilitates executive functions, and is implicated in behavioral flexibility, adaptation to changes, and high-order decision-making (Alexander et al., 1986; Chudasama and Robbins, 2006; Gerraty et al., 2018; Seo et al., 2012). During social interactions, the simultaneous representations of one's own and others’ intentions and beliefs may lead to social conflicts and thus require executive control to flexibly switch between appropriate perspectives. Therefore, such a process may engage the frontostriatal network to reduce social conflict and make decisions.Interestingly, the TPJ is not consistently shown in the contrast of high versus low levels of social strategic thinking (Coricelli and Nagel, 2009; Nagel et al., 2018). One possibility is that the TPJ represents the cognitive aspect of the theory of mind (ToM; Apperly and Butterfill, 2009; Frith and Frith, 2008; Premack and Woodruff, 1978), whereas mPFC registers the motivational aspect of ToM, which is more required in goal-directed interactive social situations (Koster-Hale et al., 2017; Molenberghs et al., 2016; Schurz et al., 2014). However, most of the previously mentioned social decision-making studies use mainly turn-based cooperative or competitive games in which participants need to consider others’ perspectives in order to make plans for the next step and therefore self and other perspective thinking are not necessarily in conflict as they occur sequentially. The experimental designs do not allow specific examination of the self-other viewpoint conflict resolution process, which is a critical component of strategic ToM.Here, to examine whether and how people solve the conflict between self and other perspectives spontaneously to promote successful communication, we adapted a novel signaling task in which the signaler was given a target word and needed to choose a response from a list of cue words to maximize the chance that the receiver guessed the target correctly (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). This online communicative task provides an ecologically valid measure of social decision-making. Research has shown that every two words have associative strengths (AS) in natural language understanding (Deese, 1959; Nelson et al., 2000). Moreover, the AS between a word pair is directional, that is, we can differentiate between a forward associative strength (target-to-cue; egocentrically salient) and backward associative strength (cue-to-target; allocentrically salient). In the current study, the salient patterns of the forward and backward AS between words were manipulated in each trial. Optimal performance in this task requires the signaler to choose from the perspective of the partner (i.e., responding relied on the backward AS) rather than from his/her own perspective (i.e., responding relied on the forward AS). Specifically, if a signaler is successful at taking other's perspective, the signaler has to take into account the backward AS rather than the forward AS when communicating the meaning of the target word.To specify the brain activity related to this type of allocentric thinking most likely used in speakers’ goal-directed communicative behavior and differentiate it from instances where referential communication is not required, we introduced two other conditions that did not require communication. The first one was the matching condition in which both parties could see the target word and participants were asked to just match others’ responses by selecting the cue that others were likely to choose. No transmission of information was required to achieve the coordinative goal in this condition (so-called non-communicative coordination). The other one was the solo condition in which participants played the game solely and were asked to choose the response that was most salient to themselves. Of the three conditions (i.e., signaling, matching, solo), the signaling condition was the most challenging as it required perspective-taking. In the matching condition, the asymmetries of salience between cues would not necessarily hinder the success of coordination between two individuals, as we expected both to use the same salient point of view (forward AS for both players) to solve the problem (Chowdhury et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 1994). In contrast, the signaler and receiver in the signaling condition worked in opposite direction: the signaler had to select a cue to convey the meaning of a target word to the receiver and the receiver must infer the word from the cue. To do so successfully, the signaler must inhibit his/her salient perspective (from target-to-cue) and adopt the receiver's perspective (from cue-to-target).Therefore, the current design allowed us to examine whether participants were able to adjust their perspectives as they transition from a non-communicative task in which the goal was to match the response with other people (the matching condition) to a communicative task in which the goal was to send a signal to help the listener to guess the target word (the signaling condition) given differing patterns of salience among words. The solo condition served as the non-social baseline as there was no need to think about others in this condition. By combining the novel signaling task with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined the neural basis of speakers’ egocentric thinking and allocentric thinking in word selection during different contexts, such as communicative coordination and non-communicative coordination. Our study also examined how both forward and backward associative strengths are encoded in the brain, which allowed us to assess the strength of egocentric and allocentric coding. We predicted that the mPFC and ventral striatum would be recruited in the allocentric thinking process when selecting a signal with a communicative goal. Given the anatomical connections between mPFC and striatum, and their shared role in social learning, we further predicted that the coupling between the two regions plays an important role in allocentric thinking.2. Methods2.1. ParticipantsThirty paid volunteers (12 women; mean age ± SD, 23.02 ± 2.59 years) participated in the fMRI study. All participants were right-handed native speakers of English with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None of the participants suffered from psychiatric or neurological disorders or any hearing or language disorders. Participants were given Singapore dollar (S$)20 (approximately S$1 = US$0.73) for showing up and an extra monetary bonus based on performance in the tasks. All participants provided informed consent and completed the session based on the protocol that was approved by the National University of Singapore Institutional Review Board.2.2. Design and materialsOne hundred and eight sets of words were selected by a pretest (see the following session). According to the word association norms, there are two salient patterns of word association between words: the associative strength from a target word to a cue word is identified as forward AS, which is an egocentric point of view (salience from one's own point of view, self-POV); whereas the associative strength from a cue word to a target word is recognized as backward AS, which is acknowledged as an allocentric point of view (salience from the other's point of view, other-POV) (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). In each trial, one target word and three cue words were shown to participants. These three cue words had varied associative strengths with the target word. For each cue in the current study, we calculated its associative strengths with the target word from a large subject pool (see the pretest) that included direct forward strength (target-to-cue) and reverse backward strength (cue-to-target).It is worth noting that the direction of mutual salience between word pairs captured by the association norms may be asymmetric. For example, the top forward associate of ‘day’ is ‘night’ (target-to-cue: forward AS = 0.819), and the top backward associate of ‘night’ is ‘day’ (cue-to-target; AS = 0.686). Demonstrably, the patterns of salience between the target ‘day’ and cue ‘night’ are symmetrically high. In contrast, a cue ‘week’ is not a salient feature of the target ‘day’. When people think of ‘day’, they are less likely to think of ‘week’. The target ‘day’ does not strongly associate with the cue ‘week’ (forward AS = 0.022) whereas the cue ‘week’ strongly triggers the target ‘day’ (backward AS = 0.473). Therefore, the patterns of salience between the target ‘day’ and the cue ‘week’ are asymmetrically high. These high and low examples were selected from Nelson et al. (2004).The asymmetries imply a difference in perspective: what is salient from the speaker's point of view may not be salient from the listener's point of view. To enable coordination between a speaker and a listener, people should have a conceptual understanding of the dissociation between self and others’ perspectives and successfully use the right perspective to guide their communication in different contexts. Therefore, we aimed to use the asymmetric saliences between the target word and cue word to capture speakers’ perspective-taking ability in a novel signaling task. Individuals should have common knowledge of the patterns of salience in word association and select a salient word to convey the meaning of a target to boost referential communication success. To do this, we filtered the one-word targets to ensure that each one could go along with at least two cues with opposite salient features. Specifically, the cues used in each trial included a word with high forward/low backward (HFLB) AS that was more salient from one's own point of view, a word with low forward/high backward (LFHB) AS that was more salient from other's point of view, and a word with low forward/low backward (LFLB) AS as an option to detect whether the participant was engaged in the task (see Fig. 1A). The mean forward AS and backward AS values for the three types of cues across all trials in each condition are listed in Table S1.Download : Download high-res image (307KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. The experimental design. A, Stimulus structure. In each trial, participants were presented with a target word and three types of cues based on their association with the target word. Specifically, the cues used in each trial included a word with high forward/low backward (HFLB) AS that was salient from one's own point of view, a word with low forward/high backward (LFHB) AS that was salient from other's point of view, and a word with low forward/low backward (LFLB) AS as an option to detect whether the participant was engaged in the task. B, Task procedure and stimulus examples. Participants were asked to select one cue from a list tied to a specific target in three experimental conditions: (1) Signaling condition: help your partner guess the target; (2) Matching condition: match your response with your partner; (3) Solo condition: choose the first word that comes to mind. Participants were told to make a response within 10 s in each trial. Three trials of the same game type were presented consecutively as a mini block, followed by a long ITI (i.e., a fixation crosshair) for 14 s, with the order of the mini blocks counterbalanced across participants.In the current study, we also focused on whether people were able to switch their perspective from self to other in communicative coordination rather than in non-communicative coordination or the solo condition. Therefore, participants were asked to select one cue from a list tied to a specific target in three experimental conditions: a non-coordinating condition (i.e. solo condition) as a non-strategic baseline and two types of coordinating conditions (communicative coordination and non-communicative coordination). We randomly divided all word sets into three experimental conditions, resulting in 36 unique word sets for each condition. The solo condition required participants to choose the first word that came to mind based on the list of three cue options. As for the non-communicative coordinating condition (i.e., matching condition), participants and their partners had to coordinate by independently selecting the same cue response given the target word in each trial. In the communicative coordinative condition (i.e., signaling condition), participants were given the target word and had to select a cue to help their partner guess the target.2.3. AS evaluation (pretest)We used two word-association databases to construct the word-sets for our study. The first database was the University of South Florida Free Association Norms (USF; Nelson et al., 2004) from which data was taken for only normed pairs. This database contained a total of 63,619 cue-target pairs. The second database was the Small World of Words English (De Deyne et al., 2019) with 209,022 word-pairs and their association strengths.Both datasets consisted of target-cue pairs and their forward and backward association strengths. Forward association strength from target to cue was = P(cue|target), whereas the backward association strength from cue to target was = P(target|cue). We then sought to label target-cue pairs according to how high or low their forward/backward association strengths were. To define cutoffs for “high” and “low”, we looked at the distribution of all target-cue pair association strengths (separate distributions for forward and backward association strengths) and took certain limits as indicative of high or low association. For the USF word list, any association strengths below the 30th percentile were taken as “low” whereas those above the 70th percentile were taken as “high”. For the Small World of Words database, “low” was set at or below 10th percentile and “high” was set at or above 90th percentile. In this way, a target-cue pair was labeled according to its forward and backward association strengths. For example, a target-cue pair that had both high forward and high backward associations was labeled as HFHB, whereas another one with low forward and high backward strengths was labeled as LFHB. We then selected target words with three target-cue pair labels that fit the requirements of our study. Specifically, we chose target words that had HFLB, LFHB, and LFLB target-cue pairs available. When there were more than three target-cue pairs available, we used the one with the highest forward association value in the case of HFLB and the highest backward association value in the case of LFHB association. This gave us a set of 4 words: 1 target and 3 cues (i.e., three target-cue pairs in one word-set). From the word lists of the University of South Florida and Small World of Words, we retrieved a total of 251 sets and 833 sets respectively, giving us a total of 1084 word sets.We then recruited participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk service (MTurk; Buhrmester et al., 2011) to reevaluate the association ratings for all target-cue pairs (both forward and backward) that had been selected. This gave us an index of absolute association between words as opposed to the relative association (as was obtained from the word databases). Essentially, we presented MTurk workers with a target-cue pair and asked them to rate “how much the first word brings to mind the second word”, using a scale of 0-100 anchored at 0, 13, 25, 38, 50, 63, 75, 88 and 100. There was a total of 499 MTurk workers with mean age = 35.3 (SD = 9.83, 289 females) with each rating an average of 150 target-cue pairs (on average, the same rating question was answered by 11 workers). Participants rated all 3 target-cue pairs for any word-set in both forward and backward directions. The assignment of word-set and sequence of presentation of word-pairs were randomized across participants. We used data from raters who had at least an overall duration of 400 s in rating the entire list of 150 word-pairs (i.e. taking at least 2.6 s on average to rate each target-cue pair). We then took the average of evocation ratings for each target-cue pair to obtain an average evocation rating. Finally, the 1084 word-sets were ranked by the sum of AS differences for HFLB (participants’ average rating on High Forward minus Low Backward) and LFHB (High Backward minus Low Forward) cue words. The 108 sets of words with the highest AS differences were selected.2.4. ProcedureOur experimental task is illustrated in Fig. 1B. Each participant underwent fMRI scanning while performing a total of 108 trials of the game. During scanning, the subject viewed a projection of a computer screen and gave a button response with the index, middle, and ring fingers of the right hand. Participants were told that the study involved three games: (1) choose the first word that comes to mind (for solo condition); (2) match your response with your partner (for matching condition); (3) help your partner guess the target (for signaling condition). Specifically, in the solo condition, participants were told that they had to choose the first word (out of the three options) that came to their mind given the target word for each trial and they would be given a fixed bonus (S$2) regardless of their performance. In the matching condition, participants were told that in each trial they would be randomly paired with one other person who had taken part in this game with the same sets of words before them, and none of them knew whom they would be paired with. In addition, participants were instructed that the aim of the game was to coordinate or match their choices with that of their partners and their partners were also asked to do so. To increase the participants’ motivation to match their responses with their respective partners, participants were informed that both players would receive an extra 20 cents for every choice that matched, and the maximum bonus across trials was S$7.2. In the signaling condition, participants were asked to communicate effectively with their partners, and they were informed that there were two different roles in the game. Participants were assigned the role of signalers, while their partners who had taken part in the game with the same sets of words played as receivers. In each trial, the participant as a signaler had to choose a cue word from the list to convey the meaning of the target word to the receiver. In terms of communication success, the receiver must infer the meaning from the cue to decipher the target word. Participants were informed that both communicators would be rewarded 20 cents if the word they chose led their partner to successfully guess the given target word in a trial (previously) and the maximum bonus across trials was S$7.2. Unbeknownst to the participants until the end of the study, in reality, there was no pairing of participants in the matching and signaling condition.Trials started with a fixation inter-trial interval (ITI) of 1.5-3.5 s (jittered), after which a game appeared. On each trial, participants would see the instruction of the game on top of the screen and a target word was shown at the center of the screen along with three cues. When given the target word, participants were asked to select a cue from the list based on the instruction shown in each trial. In addition, participants were told that they should avoid choosing the word strictly from their personal life, and instead, they should make the choice based on shared world knowledge, the knowledge that most people would know. In order to give the participants enough time to think about their choices and conduct the experiment within the time constraint of the scanner, participants were told to make a response within 10 s, beyond which the stimuli would disappear without recording any response. The positions (left/middle/right) of the three types of cues (i.e. Word LFHB, Word HFLB, and Word LFLB) were counterbalanced across trials. In an effort to ensure that participants considered all possible responses to each question probed and reduce cross-trial habituation of the neural responses, the order of trials was pseudo-randomly determined for each participant: three trials of the same game type were presented consecutively as a mini block, followed by a long ITI (i.e., a fixation crosshair) for 14 s. The mini blocks of the three game types were presented sequentially for each participant and the order of the presentation of the three game types was counterbalanced across participants. Additionally, the order of the word sets in every three trials of the same game type was randomized across participants.We did not provide any feedback to the participants in between trials. Before scanning, all participants received a written instruction about the experimental procedure and completed a practice session on a computer with another selected sets of words that were not used in the formal study to ensure comprehension of the game.2.5. Behavioral data analysisFor each experimental condition, task response was acquired and reaction time (RT) was measured. Prior to computing the mean percentage and RT of each choice, we omitted trials with reaction time less than 400 ms, which were rare. To examine perspective-taking in each condition, we focused on the difference between the self-POV option and the other-POV option by taking the proportion of participants choosing the Word HFLB to subtract the proportion of choosing the Word LFHB. We conducted a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA to analyze the self-other perspective differences for the three conditions, using the condition (i.e. solo, matching, and signaling) as the within-subject variable, and the proportion of individual's choice difference between Word HFLB and Word LFHB as a dependent variable. In addition, a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted using the condition (solo, matching, and signaling) and the word perspective (Word HFLB and Word LFHB) as independent factors and the mean RT to make the choice as the dependent variable. In these analyses, the Greenhouse-Geisser corrected degrees of freedom for non-sphericity was applied where appropriate. Multiple comparisons were controlled using the Bonferroni correction.We further investigated the relationship between the coordinative effect across different conditions. In the solo and matching condition, the coordinative effect was calculated using the frequency of choosing the Word HFLB minus the frequency of choosing the Word LFHB; while in the signaling condition, the coordinative effect was identified in an opposite way using the frequency of choosing the Word LFHB minus the frequency of choosing the Word HFLB. Because the normality assumption is violated (as revealed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), Spearman rank-order correlation analysis was used. To show the robustness of the correlation results, outliers that were either 1.5 times the interquartile range or more above the third quartile or 1.5 times the interquartile range or more below the first quartile of the data in each condition were removed. This resulted in one participant's data being removed.Because responses to our novel signaling task were presumed to be based on forward and backward salience, we further tested whether individuals’ responses could be predicted by the associative strengths between the target words and the cue words. For example, in the signaling condition, high backward AS may be positively correlated with the proportion of participants choosing Word LFHB across the trials. Hence, the relationship between the associative strength and participants’ choice was analyzed with generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) with the LME4 package in R statistical software (version 3.6.1; R Core Team, 2019). Binomial mixed-effects regressions with the target word treated as a random intercept were performed separately for each type of games as in the previous study (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). Using mixed-effects models, we were able to take into account the variability in word items (Baayen et al., 2008; Barr et al., 2013; Bates et al., 2015). See supplementary for another regression model that included subjects and word items as the random intercepts. All data (as well as the R scripts for GLMM analyses) are available at the Open Science Framework (OSF) https://osf.io/w6khb.2.6. fMRI data acquisitionImaging was performed on a Siemens PRISMA 3T MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil at the Clinical Imaging Research Centre of the National University of Singapore. Functional images were collected using a 2-dimensional multiband single-shot T2*-weighted, echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (78 slices, 2 mm-thickness; TR = 1000 ms; TE = 31.40 ms; flip angle = 60°; FOV = 220 mm; matrix size = 88 × 88; voxel size: 2.5 × 2.5 × 2.0 mm3) with a multi-band acceleration factor of 6 covering the entire brain in the oblique axial plane. A high resolution (1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm3) T1-weighted MPRAGE anatomical image (TR = 2300 ms; TE = 2.22 ms; flip angle = 8; 1 mm-thickness) was acquired for registration and normalization of functional data to the standard brain. The total acquisition time for MPRAGE is 4 min and 52 s. Head padding was used for each subject to minimize head motion, and headphones and earplugs were used to dampen the scanner noise.2.7. fMRI data analysisQuality control was done with the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC, version 0.15.2) (Esteban et al., 2017). The signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., snr) in our data ranged from 4.30 to 5.40. Mean framewise displacement (FD) and temporal derivative of the voxel time course variance (DVARS) were used as the main quality control measures for the functional imaging data (Power et al., 2012). FD is a data quality index expressing instantaneous head-motion based on change in head position across frames. DVARS is another quality index that estimates the rate of change of BOLD signal across the whole brain at each frame. Participants were excluded if the mean FD value for one run exceeded 0.3 mm (fd_mean from MRIQC), or if the DVARS was more than 6% BOLD signal change (DVARS_nstd from MRIQC of over 60). No participants were excluded based on this standard.We preprocessed and analyzed fMRI data using SPM12 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). The first eight volumes were discarded due to unsteady magnetization. To correct for head-motion, the remaining volumes were realigned spatially to the first non-discarded volume. Images were then re-sliced to obtain a mean image. The anatomical image was then co-registered to the mean functional image after motion correction and segmentation, generating parameters for normalization. All volumes were subsequently normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and resampled to 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 isotropic voxel. The normalized functional images were then spatially smoothed with Gaussian kernel with 8 mm FWHM. Lastly, we applied a high-pass temporal filter with a cutoff of 128 s to remove low-frequency drifts.After preprocessing, statistical analysis of the event-related fMRI signals was performed for each participant using the general linear model (GLM) (Friston et al., 1994). In our task, each trial consisted of one event aligned to the presentation of the three cue options with the target word. To dissociate the fMRI activity for different trials, regressors were constructed by convolving the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) at the time of response with zero duration. This is the juncture whereby participants made their choices. The first-level GLM design matrix was made up of six regressors of interest: the combinations of three game types (solo, matching, and signaling conditions) and two participants’ choices (choosing Word LFHB and choosing Word HFLB). As participants made the choices based on their own beliefs, the number of trials was a bit different across six regressors (mean trial ± SD for Matching HFLB: 19 ± 4; Matching LFHB: 15 ± 5; Signaling HFLB: 15 ± 6; Signaling LFHB: 19 ± 6; Solo HFLB: 21 ± 4; Solo LFHB: 13 ± 4). As the word choice reflected the perspective that participants were taking (self-POV or other-POV), the current model allowed us to investigate: the neural differences between the other-POV and self-POV choice within each condition (i.e. Signaling LFHB vs. Signaling HFLB, Matching LFHB vs. Matching HFLB and Solo LFHB vs. Solo HFLB). All regressors were further modulated by a parametric modulator containing the difference between the forward and backward associative strengths of the chosen option. The aim of testing the modulator effect was to investigate whether and how the brain responded to the degree of salience between forward and backward AS across different situations in a quantitative way. In addition, the six scan-to-scan motion parameters produced during realignment were included as additional regressors in the GLM to account for residual motion effects. The contrasts of the first-level analysis were entered into a one-sample t-test for the second-level group analysis conducted with a random effect statistical model.To assess the functional connectivity among regions in the signaling conditions, we conducted generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analyses with a gPPI toolbox (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/gppi) to examine the covariation between the neural activities in two brain areas (McLaren et al., 2012). We were particularly interested in the brain areas that showed variation of functional connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex during the signaling condition. The seed regions were created using a 6-mm diameter sphere at the left (peak coordinate MNI: x, y, z = -8, 44, -2) and right of mPFC (peak coordinate MNI: x, y, z = 2, 42, 8) as identified in the whole-brain analysis while comparing the word LFHB with the word HFLB in the signaling condition. For completeness, we also ran two additional gPPI analyses with the contrasts of Word LFHB vs. Word HFLB in the matching condition and solo condition.At the first-level analysis, we first extracted the de-convolved time series within the seed region as the physiological regressor. We then define all regressors in the designed GLM as the psychological regressors. These two terms were multiplied as the PPI regressors. All these regressors were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function to model the BOLD signal. In addition, six head-motion parameters were included as covariates to account for residual motion effects. We further carried out whole-brain regression analyses between gPPI connectivity estimates and the mean coordinative effect based on participants’ choice. The contrasts between the PPI regressors (e.g., word LFHB vs. word HFLB in the signaling condition) for each participant were used at the second-level analysis with their corresponding behavioral index as a covariate (e.g., choosing the Word LFHB - choosing the Word HFLB in the signaling condition).To correct for multiple comparisons, results were obtained at a voxel-level height threshold of p < 0.005 and survived after cluster-level family-wise error correction (FWE) at p < 0.05. In addition, small volume correction (SVC) with FWE corrected p-value (p < 0.05) was used on a priori regions of interest previously implicated in mentalizing and interpersonal strategic thinking: medial prefrontal cortex (MNI, x, y, z = ± 3, 51, -9 mm) (Coricelli and Nagel, 2009), temporo-parietal junction (x, y, z = ± 52, -30, 10 mm) (Schurz et al., 2014), ventral striatum (x, y, z = ± 10, 10, -6 mm) (Yoshida et al., 2010), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (x, y, z = ± 6, 30, 42 mm) (Nagel et al., 2018). Spherical search space with 8 mm radius was defined surrounding the independently defined coordinates reported above. For display purposes, all contrast images are depicted at p < 0.005, uncorrected. All results are available on Neurovault (Gorgolewski et al., 2015); see https://identifiers.org/neurovault.collection:9096.3. Results3.1. Behavioral resultsAlthough participants were free to make their own decisions by choosing any options provided, the Word LFLB was rarely chosen. The proportions of participants choosing the Word LFLB in three conditions were low, as would be expected (mean ± SD, Solo: 0.056 ± 0.043; Matching: 0.057 ± 0.041; Signaling: 0.038 ± 0.038), providing evidence that participants were able to identify the strongly associated cues with the target word across trials and continued to be engaged in the tasks throughout the experiment.Our first analysis on the proportion of participants choosing the Word HFLB (self-POV) minus the proportion of participants choosing the Word LFHB (other-POV) revealed a significant main effect (F(2, 58) = 18.234, p < 0.001, ηp2= 0.385; Fig. 2A) for the condition. Our post-hoc analysis found that the mean choice difference in the signaling condition (mean = -0.105, 95% CI [-0.193, -0.018]) was significantly lower than that in the matching condition (mean = 0.092, 95% CI [0.024, 0.160], p = 0.001) and the solo condition (mean = 0.205, 95% CI [0.136, 0.0.275], p < 0.001), with these latter conditions having no significant difference between them (p = 0.101). These results suggest that participants did use the allocentric perspective to convey the message in the signaling condition. Our findings support the idea that people are able to differentiate the salient patterns between egocentric and allocentric perspective in different word pairs and flexibly switch the perspective from self to other to select the optimal signal.Download : Download high-res image (279KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 2. Behavioral results of the experiment.

B, Mean reaction time as a function of condition (solo, matching, and signaling) and word perspective (choosing Word LFHB and choosing Word HFLB). The violin plots indicate the density of the sample distribution across the y-values. Error bars represent within-subject 95% CIs.A two-way repeated measures ANOVA on the mean reaction time found no significant two-way interaction effect between the condition and the word perspective (F(2, 58) = 0.081, p = 0.922, ηp2 = 0.003, Fig. 2B), and no significant main effect for the word perspective (F(1, 29) = 1.393, p = 0.248, ηp2 = 0.046). However, a significant main effect for the condition (F(1.477, 42.843) = 30.055, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.509) was observed. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the RT in the signaling condition (mean = 4.741, 95% CI [4.593, 4.889]) was longer than that in the matching condition (mean = 4.465, 95% CI [4.369, 4.561], p = 0.007) and in the solo condition (mean = 4.067, 95% CI [3.928, 4.207], p < 0.001). In addition, participants’ decision-making was observably slower in the matching condition than the solo condition (p < 0.001). The slower responses in the signaling condition indicated that coordination in a communicative context involves more complex inferential processing in general.Additionally, correlation tests were conducted to examine the relationships of the coordinative effect among the three conditions. Spearman's correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between the coordinative effects in the matching condition (HFLB - LFHB) and the signaling condition (LFHB - HFLB) (rs = -0.422, p = 0.023, n = 29), suggesting that taking the perspectives from one's point of view in a non-communicative task may impede an individual from switching to others’ point of view in a communicative task. We also found that the coordinative effect in the solo condition was marginally correlated with that in the matching condition (rs = 0.357, p = 0.058, n = 29) but not correlated with that in the signaling condition (rs = -0.313, p = 0.098, n = 29).To statistically examine whether and how the proportion of participants choosing each cue was predicted by the salient patterns of egocentric and/or allocentric perspective in different situations, binomial mixed-effects regressions were performed separately for each type of games (Sulik and Lupyan, 2018). For each condition, the model included the forward and backward AS as fixed effects and the count of participants choosing each type of cues as the dependent variable. The two continuous independent variables were centered on zero and scaled as the model required. We included a random intercept for target word. In a first step, we fitted a null model in which we only put the random effect of the target word. In the second step, the fixed effects (forward and backward AS of the chosen word) were added to the models. In a final step, the interactions between the fixed effects were added to a new model. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to compare the models, with and without interaction terms, between the fixed effects. Specifically, the model with lower AIC was considered to have a better model fit. The results showed that models with interaction terms were better than models without interaction terms for all models of three game types (model fit for the matching condition: AIC = 1237, χ2(1) = 33.731, p < 0.001; solo condition: AIC = 1027, χ2(1) = 4.388, p = 0.036; signaling condition: AIC = 944.29, χ2(1) = 10.455, p = 0.001).Therefore, we focused on the models with interaction terms between forward and backward AS for each condition. In the signaling condition, parameter estimates indicated that there were significant main effects for forward AS (β = 0.646, SE = 0.058, z = 11.124, p < 0.001) and backward AS (β = 0.854, SE = 0.061, z = 13.983, p < 0.001). Through the comparison of the model parameters, it showed that the main effect of forward AS was smaller than that of backward AS in the signaling condition. Moreover, the two-way interaction between forward and backward AS significantly affected participants’ choice (β = -0.214, SE = 0.066, z = -3.225, p = 0.001). This finding suggests that backward AS had larger effect on participants’ choice when forward AS was low (see Fig. 3A). For the matching condition, we found significant main effects for forward AS (β = 0.816, SE = 0.064, z = 12.795, p < 0.001) and backward AS (β = 0.649, SE = 0.072, z = 9.027, p < 0.001), and also found a significant interaction effect (β = -0.416, SE = 0.072, z = -5.752, p < 0.001), suggesting that the backward AS had much weaker effect when forward AS was high (see Fig. 3B). For the solo condition, we found significant main effects for forward AS (β = 1.110, SE = 0.070, z = 15.789, p < 0.001) and backward AS (β = 0.321, SE = 0.082, z = 3.913, p < 0.001), and a significant interaction effect (β = -0.166, SE = 0.081, z = -2.048, p = 0.041) was also observed, suggesting that backward AS only showed weak effect when forward AS was low (see Fig. 3C). A comparison of the model parameters showed that the main effect of forward AS was larger than that of backward AS in the matching condition and solo condition, suggesting that choices in these two conditions were mainly influenced by forward AS.Download : Download high-res image (432KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 3.

B, In the matching condition, there was a strong forward AS effect on participants’ choices, and the backward AS only had a positive effect when forward AS was low. C, In the solo condition, there was a strong forward AS effect on participants’ choices, and the modulation effect of the backward AS in this condition was weaker than that in the matching condition (by comparing the middle and right panels).3.2. fMRI resultsTable 1 lists all significant peak activations for the comparisons between Word LFHB and Word HFLB in each condition. For the signaling condition, we compared word LFHB with word HFLB and found activity in the bilateral mPFC, right ventral striatum, right TPJ, superior frontal gyrus (SFG), left precuneus, and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (Fig. 4A). No significant activation was found for the reverse contrast. Our parametric analysis further showed that activity in the left ventral striatum in response to the Word LFHB was positively correlated with the differences between the forward and backward associative strengths during decision making (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the ventral striatum may encode the interference from the salience feature of forward association strength. In the matching condition, Word LFHB versus Word HFLB only activated the left ventral striatum (Fig. 4D). No significant activation was found for the reverse contrast. The parametric analysis showed that activity in the mPFC in response to the decision of choosing Word HFLB was significantly correlated with the differences between the forward and backward associative strengths (Fig. 5B). For the solo condition, no supra-threshold clusters were found for the contrast of Word LFHB versus Word HFLB or Word HFLB versus Word LFHB (Fig. 4E). The parametric analysis in the solo condition found increased activity in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) as the differences between the forward and backward associative strengths increased when choosing Word HFLB (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the interaction contrast between the signaling condition and the solo condition [Signaling (LFHB > HFLB) vs. Solo (LFHB > HFLB)] revealed brain activity in the right supramarginal gyrus, bilateral TPJ, bilateral mPFC, and right ventral striatum (Fig. 4B), suggesting that these regions really tap into allocentric thinking in the signaling context.Table 1.

The regions with significant activation in high order PPI analyses are listed in Table 2. In other words, participants who were more capable of switching their viewpoint from self to other in communication showed higher levels of coupling between the mPFC and ventral striatum (Fig. 4C, right panel). This coactivation between mPFC and ventral striatum was not found in the non-communicative conditions, i.e., matching and solo conditions.Table 2.

DiscussionUsing a novel signaling task combined with fMRI, we examined the neural correlates of allocentric thinking during communication. We found that the mPFC, ventral striatum, and TPJ were more engaged when participants made allocentric choices in a communicative context. The interference from forward AS was associated with activity in the ventral striatum. Moreover, the neural coupling between mPFC and ventral striatum predicted individual differences in choosing the allocentric choices to promote communication success. These patterns were not found in the control conditions that do not require communicative signaling. Our findings highlight the crucial role of mPFC and striatum in allocentric thinking in social contexts, going beyond their putative role in coding the subjective value of reward and reward prediction error.In the signaling condition, signalers need to choose the most effective cue to help listeners get the message to be sent. It is crucial for the signaler to take the perspective of the person receiving the signal and consider the cue that is likely to be inferred correctly by the receiver. Our behavioral data showed that participants were more likely to choose LFHB words than HFLB words in the signaling condition but not in the other two conditions, suggesting that they do have the ability to think from receivers’ point of view if needed. In addition, the reaction times of making decisions were slower in the signaling condition compared with the other two conditions, suggesting that signaling to others is generally more taxing than non-communicative coordination with others. Our regression model further showed that participants were indeed guided, to some degree, by backward AS when making choices in the signaling condition.Success in communication relies on speakers choosing utterances that can be used by listeners to infer the intended information. Indeed, previous studies have shown that listeners spontaneously seek to incorporate information about the speaker's mental state during communication. In a targeted language game in which participants had a joint goal requiring them to exchange information, eye-tracking data showed that addressees used the distinction between shared and private information as they interpreted language on-line (Brown-Schmidt et al., 2008; Heller et al., 2008). In interactive conversations, listeners represent information about the perspective of the speaker and use this information to guide the processing of the speaker's utterances (Frank and Goodman, 2012; Franke and Degen, 2016). Taken together, these findings corroborate that successful communication is contingent on mutual strategic reasoning-from both the speaker sending relevant information, and the listener extracting it.Importantly, our study found enhanced activity in the mPFC, ventral striatum, and TPJ when participants chose LFHB words over HFLB words in the singling condition. The TPJ has been found in mentalizing tasks using hypothetical scenarios. It has been proposed that TPJ represents an epistemic or cognitive aspect of mentalization, whereas mPFC encodes the motivational component of ToM (Jenkins and Mitchell, 2010; Koster-Hale et al., 2017). The TPJ activity in our study may reflect individuals’ understanding of others’ knowledge. Both the mPFC and ventral striatum are implicated in both reward-based learning and social learning (Garrison et al., 2013). It has been suggested that the mPFC serves as a module that integrates social information and represents intentionality at a more abstract cognitive level (Sui and Gu, 2017; Van Overwalle, 2009). Previous studies have shown that mPFC represents the similarity between self and others (Mobbs et al., 2015; Mobbs et al., 2009). Dumontheil et al. (2010a, 2010b) using the director task also found parts of the mentalizing network, including the mPFC and temporal pole, was activated when individuals followed the director's instructions to move objects. A neuroimaging meta-analysis further confirmed that mPFC is closely linked to perspective-taking (D'Argembeau et al., 2007; Denny et al., 2012). The enhanced activity in mPFC when participants engage in allocentric thinking may indicate switching from self-centered to other-centered perspectives. Spatial and functional gradience for mentalizing has been shown in mPFC (Denny et al., 2012). It has been demonstrated that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is more associated with self-processing (Hu et al., 2016; Sui and Humphreys, 2015), while the dorsomedial prefrontal is more associated with other-related processing, such as mentalizing/theory of mind (Hu et al., 2016; Sul et al., 2015). Both ventral and dorsal mPFC were activated in response to allocentric thinking in our signaling condition. Our findings may suggest that taking other-oriented perspectives involves both the self-referential process and mentalizing processes. The functional segregation and integration of mPFC subregions in communicative contexts may be an interesting topic for future studies. The ventral striatum plays a crucial role in goal-directed learning (Guo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2020; O'Doherty et al., 2004) as well as reward processing (Yaple et al., 2020). It is important to note that activity in the ventral striatum was correlated with the degree of interference induced by the conflict between forward and backward associative strengths. Our findings may suggest that the ventral striatum encodes the conflict between allocentric and egocentric thinking and subsequently guides signaling behaviors. In addition, even without an exogenous reward in the current study, successfully detecting and solving such a viewpoint conflict to achieve the communicative goal might be itself the reward. Indeed, the Rational Speech Act theory considers communication as a goal-directed activity and the speaker derives the social utility of helping the listener to achieve communicative goals (Goodman and Frank, 2016). The ventral striatum may be engaged in detecting the need for such perspective-changing to enable goal achievement.Moreover, we found that the functional connectivity between mPFC and ventral striatum predicted individual differences in the degree of allocentric thinking, indexing by the difference between the percentage of participants choosing Word LFHB and choosing Word HFLB in the signaling condition. Across a wide range of psychological tasks, a meta-analytic coactivation analysis showed mPFC coactivation with subcortical regions, especially the ventral striatum (de la Vega et al., 2016). Altered ventral striatal-medial prefrontal cortex connectivity has been found in individuals with social problems (Fareri et al., 2017), stress-related psychopathology (Hanson et al., 2018), and depression (Admon and Pizzagalli, 2015), suggesting that the coupling between these two regions play a pivotal role in supporting smooth social interactions. The strength of functional connectivity between the striatum and mPFC has also been associated with learning speed in a probabilistic environment (van den Bos et al., 2012). Decreased frontostriatal functional connectivity was associated with reduced cognitive flexibility (Vaghi et al., 2017). Frontostriatal hyperconnectivity in high performing individuals in a signaling task might represent their ability to inhibit the innate tendency to choose self-related words and make goal-directed choices. Our study delineates how self-other viewpoint conflicts are encoded in the brain and provides some preliminary biological evidence for the inferential processing between self and other in pragmatic reasoning.Although not the focus of our study, we also found that the ventral striatum was activated when participants chose the low forward and high backward words in the matching task. Activity in the mPFC was correlated with the difference between forward AS and backward AS when choosing Word HFLB. These findings suggest that mPFC and striatum may also play an important role in pure coordination. Our previous study found that mPFC is engaged in perspective-taking when participants managed to reach focal points during pure coordination (Chowdhury et al., 2020). In the context of pure coordination in which participants were provided with symmetry information, individuals should be guided by forward AS alone and there is no obvious conflict arising from the differences between forward and backward AS. Thus, such coordination does not require the inhibition of automatic egocentric thinking driven by forward AS. Nevertheless, perspective-taking is needed for successful coordination even though one's own perspective and others’ perspective may just be the same in most cases.In summary, although mentalizing has been linked to several brain regions, our study points out the key role of the mPFC-striatum network in supporting spontaneous allocentric thinking in successful communication. Our findings contribute to the deconstruction and specification of the mentalizing processes in social communication and shed light on how the brain implements viewpoint conflict resolution to achieve communicative signaling goals. Future studies may further examine whether modulating activity in this frontostriatal network could boost or hinder performance in communicative tasks.Data and code availability statementThe data and/or code used in the study are available upon direct request.CreditShanshan Zhen: Conceptualization, Data collection and analysis, Writing - original draft.
