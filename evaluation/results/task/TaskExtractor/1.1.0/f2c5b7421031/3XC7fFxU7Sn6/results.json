    "StudyObjective": "To examine the activation and connectivity of the brain under three different conditions: right ankle dorsiflexion (Task) as the baseline; ankle dorsiflexion coupled with simultaneous stimulation to the agonist muscle (Task+AgonistStim); and to a control area without agonist or antagonist muscles going through (Task+ControlStim).",

            "TaskName": "Ankle Dorsiflexion Task",
            "TaskDescription": "Participants performed repetitive alternating dorsiflexion and relaxation of the right foot, paced by an audio cue every 1.5 seconds. The last audio cue was a verbal command to stop. The task aimed to assess brain activation patterns during voluntary movement with and without somatosensory stimulation.",
            "DesignDetails": "The fMRI session consisted of nine rest-task cycles, each lasting 30 seconds. The total duration of the fMRI experiment was 570 seconds. Each task period was preceded by a verbal command delivered within a 2-second duration, 3 seconds ahead of each task period. Participants were trained to perform the motor task gently to avoid large head motions.",
