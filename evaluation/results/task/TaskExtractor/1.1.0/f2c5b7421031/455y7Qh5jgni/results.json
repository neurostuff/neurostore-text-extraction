            "DesignDetails": "The task consisted of a learning phase followed by a generalization phase, both occurring within a single scanning session. Each trial presented a scene with two buildings, one concealing a reward. Participants had 3 seconds to select the rewarded building, followed by 7 seconds of video feedback and a 1-second intertrial interval. There were 48 trials per discrimination presented in a pseudorandom order, with 12 test trials in the generalization phase.",
