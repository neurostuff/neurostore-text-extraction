Faces were displayed for 1500ms with a pseudo-exponentially distributed SOA of 5000ms (75%), 7500ms (17%), and 10000ms (8%). Trials were presented in a randomized order with a 50% probability for congruent and incongruent conditions. A black fixation dot was displayed throughout the task to ensure accurate fixation.",
