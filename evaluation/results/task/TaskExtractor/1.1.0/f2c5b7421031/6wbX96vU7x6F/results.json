            "TaskDescription": "In the MIDT, a bet (a dollar, a cent, or no money) appeared on the screen at the beginning of each trial. After a randomized fore-period between 1 and 5s, a target box was shown for a short period. Subjects were instructed to press a button as quickly as possible to collect the money (win) before the target box disappeared. An accurate trial was defined by a button press before disappearance of the target box. Otherwise, subjects would lose the bet, with the amount deducted from the total win.",
            "DesignDetails": "The task involved two 10-minute runs with a randomized fore-period between 1 and 5 seconds. The response window started at 300ms and was stair-cased for each trial type (dollar/cent/no money) separately. The inter-trial interval was 1.5 seconds. Approximately 42% of all trials were dollar trials, 42% were cent trials, and no money constituted the remaining trials.",
