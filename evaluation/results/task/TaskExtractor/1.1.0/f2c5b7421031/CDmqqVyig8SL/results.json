The task aimed to assess the relationship between hippocampal pattern completion and neocortical reinstatement across different delays.",
            "DesignDetails": "The task was event-related, consisting of two encoding sessions separated by 24 hours, followed by a retrieval session inside the scanner. Each encoding session included 90 trials, with a mix of closed-loop and open-loop pairwise associations. During retrieval, participants performed a six-alternative forced-choice task with a maximum of 6 seconds to respond, preceded by a 1-second fixation and followed by a 1-second blank screen.",
