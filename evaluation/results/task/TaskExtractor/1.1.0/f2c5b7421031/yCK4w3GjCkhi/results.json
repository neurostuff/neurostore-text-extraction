            "TaskDescription": "Participants were instructed to stay alert and focused on a fixation cross while listening to auditory stimuli, including words and noise, and to repeat the words they heard during the word repetition task. The primary measures included neural activity in response to word recognition and accuracy of word repetition.",
            "DesignDetails": "Functional MRI scanning took place over four scanning blocks, alternating between blocks of attentive listening and word repetition. The order of blocks was counterbalanced. Each block consisted of auditory stimuli presented with a specific timing structure, and participants' spoken responses were recorded for accuracy.",
