            "DesignDetails": "During scanning, participants engaged in a first-person virtual reality environment where they had to select a rewarded building among two options based on wall texture configurations. Each trial lasted 3 seconds for the selection, followed by 7 seconds of feedback and a 1-second inter-trial interval. There were 48 trials per discrimination presented in a pseudorandom order, and the generalization phase involved 12 test trials.",
