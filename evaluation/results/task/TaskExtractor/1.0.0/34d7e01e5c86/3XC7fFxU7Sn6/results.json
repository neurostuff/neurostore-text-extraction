    "StudyObjective": "To examine the activation and connectivity of the brain under three different conditions: (1) right ankle dorsiflexion (Task) as the baseline; (2) ankle dorsiflexion coupled with simultaneous stimulation to the agonist muscle (Task+AgonistStim); and (3) to a control area without agonist or antagonist muscles going through (Task+ControlStim).",

            "TaskDescription": "The motor task consisted of repetitive alternating dorsiflexion and relaxation of the right foot.",
            "DesignDetails": "The fMRI session was composed of nine rest-task cycles with 30 s for each period. Foot movements were paced following an audio cue that was sounded every 1.5 s. The last audio cue is a verbal command 'stop'. The verbal command 'ready, right foot movement, go' was delivered within a 2 s duration that is 3 s ahead of each task period. Each subject was trained prior to MR scanning to perform the motor task as gently as possible.",
