            "DesignDetails": "The paradigm consisted of 120 faces (60 males and 60 females) previously presented in a familiarization task. Faces were displayed for 1500ms in the center of a white screen. An event-related design was used to identify separate trial-related Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses. Trial onsets randomly varied with a pseudo-exponentially distributed SOA of 5000ms (75%), 7500ms (17%) and 10,000ms (8%). Both trial types were presented in a randomized order and occurred with a probability of 50%. Subjects had to indicate whether a face was male or female by pressing the left or right mouse button, with button assignments counterbalanced across participants.",
