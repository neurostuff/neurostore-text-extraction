            "DesignDetails": "In the MIDT, a bet appeared on the screen at the beginning of each trial, followed by a randomized fore-period between 1 and 5 seconds. A target box was shown for a short period, and subjects were instructed to press a button as quickly as possible to collect the money before the target box disappeared. An accurate trial was defined by a button press before the target box disappeared. The inter-trial interval was 1.5 seconds, and the response window started at 300 milliseconds, stair-cased for each trial type. Each subject completed two 10-minute runs of the task, with a total of 1844 trials across subjects.",
