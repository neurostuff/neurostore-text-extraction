            "DesignDetails": "During retrieval, participants were presented with a cue and six potential targets. The cue was presented in the middle of the screen with the six possible targets displayed below. Participants had a maximum of 6 seconds to respond with a button corresponding to the target position. Each trial was preceded by a 1-second fixation and followed by a 1-second blank screen. The presentation order was optimized to measure univariate BOLD activity across four within-subject experimental conditions (open-loop, delay; open-loop, no-delay; closed-loop, delay; closed-loop, no-delay).",
