            "DesignDetails": "The active blocks consisted of 12 trials and lasted 36s, interleaved with 24s rest blocks. Participants responded to targets and nontargets by pressing one of two different buttons, with the side of the buttons counterbalanced across participants. The experiment included five functional runs (two safe runs without any sounds and three threat runs with the possible occurrence of aversive sounds), presented in a counterbalanced order. TNT difficulty levels (0back and 2back) were counterbalanced and alternated with rest periods.",
