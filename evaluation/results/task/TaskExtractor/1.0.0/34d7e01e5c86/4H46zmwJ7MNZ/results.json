            "DesignDetails": "The task involved watching a dancer perform a sequence of movements cued by auditory signals. Participants had to indicate whether the dancer's last movement was correct or not. The task included 400 single movements, with 32 movements not according to cue. The design allowed for contrasting predicted with prediction-violating movements, and included breaks for question trials.",
