            "DesignDetails": "The task involved a fine motor learning task with accurate, rapid tracing of randomized trail mazes, counterbalanced with a matched gross motor comparison task. Each scan was 6 minutes long, consisting of seven on-blocks of 24 seconds each, interleaved with jittered rest blocks averaging 24 seconds. Each scan began and ended with a rest block, and the trails were designed to be too complex to be completed in a single 24-second block.",
