A functional sequence was added to each functional imaging session performed in our lab (Figure  ), taking advantage of the continuous flow of volunteers recruited for various protocols. Because we wanted to capture the maximal amount of functional information in the minimum amount of time, we designed the sequence according the following challenging constraints: \n\n▪ the sequence had to be short, so as to disrupt as little as possible the main protocol. We choose 5 minutes for performing 100 trials. \n\n▪ we aimed to obtain for each subject a description of different levels of functional architecture, from sensori-motor areas (perception and action) to more associative areas involved in reading, language processing and calculation. \n\n▪ we aimed to capture in 5 minutes most of the individual networks related to each task. \n\n▪ individual networks described in 5 min had to be reproducible over sessions and time. \n\nThe feasibility of using short stimulation designs (ranging from 10 to 25 min long) to reveal individual functional maps has been previously assessed for language mapping [ ], for visual areas [ ] and recently for a set of functional networks covering sensorimotor processes, working memory, executive functions and emotional processes [ ]. Beyond that point, the main goal of the current study was to use the data obtained with this fMRI protocol with individual subjects as the cornerstone of a large-scale hybrid database. Because the individual functional information that can be captured in such a short sequence should be considered with caution, we focus here on the design efficiency and within-subject. We then describe preliminary data obtained from 81 subjects scanned in a 3T scanner and address new methodological issues including statistical methods for analysis and visualization of inter-individual functional variability. Subsequent publications will exploit the potential of this database to focus on characterizing inter-individual variability. ']",,

The word list for the task consisted of 110 kana nouns obtained from the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone corporation (NTT) psycholinguistic database called ""Lexical Properties of Japanese"" [ ]. Words were matched on linguistic parameters including word frequency, imagability, number of syllables, and key positions on the QWERTY keyboard so as not to require unequal hand usage. All words consisted of four or five kana characters (seven to nine alphabetic characters) and did not include the Roman characters q, w, z, x, c, v, p, or l, because there are relatively few opportunities to press these keys in the Japanese language and these characters are located in the corners of the QWERTY keyboard ( ).

Although there are other ways of typing, all subjects were instructed to type using the alphabetical input method. \n\nThe keys pressed were recorded through the optical fibers placed in the keyboard buttons and the accuracy of typewriting was calculated offline. The percentage of left-hand and right-hand usage on the keyboard was calculated for each word to ensure that there was no bias in hand use. Behavioral data obtained from the typing experiment were processed in MATLAB 7.7.0 (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Accurate trials were defined as those for which subjects produced the correct key-pressing sequence for a given word. We were primarily interested in spelling errors as opposed to typing errors such as a slip in a keypress to the adjacent key, and we therefore did not consider key presses that were either one to the right or left of the correct key to be incorrect (e.g. for the letter “y”, “t” or “u” were considered correct).

Participants were instructed to imagine themselves in the situation described. In the rating phase (2), participants rated all stories on embarrassment and inappropriateness. \n  \nIn the story-reading phase, participants read short stories written in second person. Each story consisted of two sentences, a stem sentence (duration: 3 s) and an ending sentence (duration: 6 s). The stories described either a situation in which no social norm was transgressed (“neutral condition”), a situation in which a social norm was unintentionally transgressed (“unintentional condition”) or a situation in which a social norm was intentionally transgressed (“intentional condition”). It is important to note that the unintentional (“You are baking with friends. You use salt instead of sugar without realizing.”) and intentional (“You are baking with friends. You use salt instead of sugar as a joke.”) condition differ only in the intention of the actor, while we aimed to keep the actual outcome of the action (for example, a distasteful cake) in general the same (although the outcome of some intentional stories could be considered to be more severe in comparison to the outcome of the matching unintentional story, inherent to the verb used to describe intentionality; we refer the reader to   for a sensitivity analysis). \n\nThe stories in the SNPT-R were developed in collaboration with Karina S. Blair, author of previous work on the SNPT [ ]. All stories described everyday social situations, in which the protagonist was accompanied by at least one other person, and the stories outlined relative innocuous violations of conventional social norms, in which no severe harm was done to others. The stories were heterogeneous with respect to the context (for example, in the presence of one friend or in public space like an airport) and the nature of the social norm transgression (for example, breaking decency rules versus hurting somebody), in order to increase the external validity of the paradigm. Stories were developed to be suitable for a broad audience and age-range (for children from age 8). However, given the fact that the stories of the SNPT-R were all personal (written in ‘you’ form) in order to maximize personal involvement of participants, some small changes were necessary in stories describing age- or genderspecific elements. Therefore, four age- and gender specific versions of the task were developed: for boys < 18 years of age (version 1), girls < 18 years of age (version 2), men ≥ 18 years of age (version 3) and women ≥ 18 years of age (version 4). For example, the school environment (< 18 years) was replaced for a work environment (≥ 18 years of age), and ‘bikini bottoms’ (females) for ‘swimming trunks’ (males). However, these changes were only minimal (see   and osf.io/m8r76 for a full list of stories included in the SNPT-R [ ]). \n\nIn line with the SNPT described by Blair et al. [ ], twenty-six stem sentences were developed, with three different types of ending. Therefore, the SNPT-R consisted of 78 short stories in total. These stories were presented in a pseudo-random order using E-Prime software (version 2.0.10, Psychology Software Tools; script available at osf.io/m8r76 [ ]), separated by a fixation cross (jittered duration between 2–7 s, determined using Optseq software ( ), mean duration fixation: 3.5 s) and divided into two consecutive blocks of 39 stories (duration each block: 8 min 44 s). Participants were instructed to imagine themselves in the social situations described and to press a button with their right index finger after reading the stem sentence of each story. A button press within 3 s resulted in visual feedback to the participant (a green checkmark presented beneath the sentence). This element was added to the paradigm in order to be able to check whether participants engaged with the task. Prior to the start of the experiment, all participants were familiarized with the story-reading phase by performing a short version of the task (using 5 stories). \n\nIn the (unannounced) rating phase of the task ( ), participants read all stories again and were asked to rate them on a 5-point Likert scale on embarrassment (ranging from 1, not embarrassing at all, to 5, extremely embarrassing) and inappropriateness (ranging from 1, not inappropriate at all, to 5, extremely inappropriate), similar as in the SNPT described by Blair and colleagues [ ].

The PSS values were obtained individually from the pre-fMRI experiment separately for SJ and TOJ. To be as accurate as possible the individual PSS conditions were selected as the closest COA level to that of the PSS value derived from the pre-fMRI data fits. Although COA levels in the pre-fMRI experiment were restricted to ±333, ±267, ±200, ±133, ±67, and 0 ms, COA values for the PSS condition in the fMRI experiment could be any COA level between 0 and ±333 in 16 ms increments i.e., one frame at a time. This use of an individually determined stimulus level (PSS) is similar to the approach used by Binder ( ) to determine stimuli levels, but did not use the simultaneity threshold approach based on separate sound-first and flash-first trials. For TOJ-unable participants, we used average results from a behavioral study using identical stimuli (Petrini et al.,  ). An optimized mixed block/event-related design was used to enable investigation of differences between the tasks at both transient and sustained levels of processing. \n\nEach of two functional runs (~22 min each) consisted of 32 stimulation blocks (half SJ and half TOJ, randomized) and after every two stimulation blocks there was a 16 s fixation block (Figure  ).

Each COA condition was presented a total of 40 times (20 per run) per task. To minimize the correlation between the transient (stimuli) and sustained (stimulation block) regressors the number of times an individual COA condition was presented within a single stimulation block was manipulated as follows: in a run, a COA level was presented 0 times during 4 stimulation blocks, once in 6 blocks, twice in 4 blocks and 3 times in 2 blocks, i.e., a total of 20 presentations for each COA level and task.

We considered the WTP scores as the economic value of goods, and the WTP scores for hedonic/utilitarian goods as hedonic/utilitarian values, respectively.

After self-directed stimulation, participants rated their own pain (self-directed pain ratings), using the question “How painful was this stimulus for you?” on a seven-point rating scale ranging from “not at all” to “extremely painful.” After other-directed stimulation, participants rated the other person’s pain (other-directed pain ratings; “How painful was this stimulus for the other person?” answered using the same seven-point rating scale as for the self-directed pain ratings), as well as their own unpleasantness during other-directed stimulation (unpleasantness ratings; “How unpleasant did it feel when the other person was stimulated?”; seven-point scale, from “not at all” to “extremely unpleasant”). Ratings were collected in about one third of the trials in a pseudorandomized fashion. Between trials, a fixation cross (2000\xa0ms) was presented.

This paradigm consisted of two separate runs: In the first run (self-directed affective touch), the participant was stimulated to measure behavioral responses and brain activation related to the first-hand experience of affective touch. In the second run (empathy for affective touch) a confederate acting as a second participant was supposedly undergoing affective touch, and participants were instructed to empathize with her feelings. In every single self-directed trial, visual presentation of an object was accompanied by simultaneous stroking of the left palm at 1\xa0Hz for 2\xa0s in proximal-to-distal direction with a material whose touch resembled the touch of the object depicted on the screen. For example, touching the participant’s hand with down feathers was accompanied by the picture of a chick to elicit a pleasant affective touch experience. The stimuli had been selected in extensive pretesting based on maximum agreement among participants in terms of congruency between visual and somatosensory stimulus and emotional responses (see   for paradigm validation test). In one third of the trials (5 per condition), participants were asked to rate the stimulation in that trial on a 9-point scale ranging from very unpleasant (left extreme of the scale) to very pleasant (right extreme) for either themselves or, supposedly, for the other participant (i.e., the confederate).

Participants were informed that they would play an online computerized game with a participant situated in another lab. Participants were told that they would compete in multiple trials of a reaction time competition, in which the loser of each trial received an aversive noise blast through headphones, at one of four noise levels chosen by the other player. In reality, participants played against a preset computer program designed to produce four volume levels of white noise, with volume settings ranging from 1 (60 dB) to 4 (105 dB), in 22.5 dB intervals. The TAP consisted of 16 trials ( ). Each trial began with a fixation phase, followed by a decision phase, in which participants selected the volume of noise blast that their partner would receive if their partner lost the reaction time trial. Participants then viewed a fixation cross with a jittered duration (0.5/1.0/1.5 s) before the competition phase, during which participants were required to quickly press a button when a red square target was shown on-screen (5 s). Participants then viewed their opponent’s (pre-programmed) volume setting. This time point of notification, when the participant perceived the opponent’s intended noise blast setting, was modeled as the provocation phase (see  ). Finally, in the outcome phase, participants learned whether they won or lost the trial. The “losing” outcome phase, modeled as the punishment phase, subjected participants to a 5 s noise blast delivered by their opponent. Trials were characterized as retaliatory if they followed trials with high provocation (noise levels 3 or 4) and non-retaliatory if they followed trials with low provocation (levels 1 or 2). The 16-trial task contained eight retaliatory and eight non-retaliatory trials that were randomized across participants. Wins and losses were also randomly ordered across participants.

The task had four conditions: High social preference (i.e., z-score between 1 and 5 on social preference), low social preference (i.e., z-score between −1 and −5 on social preference), high popularity (e.g., z-score between 1 and 5 on popularity), and low popularity (i.e., z-score between −1 and −5 on popularity). Within each condition, there were 10 targets, and we aimed for an equal number of boys and girls within each condition. Due to a data management error, z-scores for the targets from one of the schools (two of the six task versions) were incorrect and did not necessarily fall within the criteria (i.e., z-score between ±\xa01 and 5). Popularity and social preference scores were recalculated for the target images in these task versions. For one group of participants (n\xa0=\xa020), there were a sufficient number of target images that still fit the criteria for each condition (High Popularity =\xa09, Low Popularity =\xa08, High Social Preference = 8, Low Social Preference =\xa010), so these participants were included. For the other group, there were an insufficient number of target images fitting the criteria (e.g., as few as 5) in the conditions, so these participants (n\xa0=\xa015) were excluded. Across all versions of the task that were retained, the average z-score within each condition was approximately 2 (see supplement for details). There was no overlap in the targets across conditions, such that each target belonged in only one sociometric category and appeared in only one condition. No participants were included as targets so that no participant would see their own image. Target photos were obtained from school yearbooks from the previous school year, the same year the sociometric ratings were collected. Yearbook photos were digitized into JPEG images.

Participants then completed the selection phase whereby they viewed 60 photographs of mid- to late-adolescents (30 boys, 30 girls) and then placed 30 peers into an “interested” (liked) and 30 into a “not interested” (unliked) onscreen bin.

On each trial, for 2\xa0s, the photograph of each peer for whom participants had previously indicated their interest was displayed, and a reminder appeared about whether participants had judged the peer as one of interest (liked) or not (unliked). An inter-stimulus interval of 2, 4, 6, or 8\xa0s was included in equal numbers per duration length across the 60 trials (i.e., 15 trials).

Due to a data management error,   z  -scores for the targets in two of the six task versions were incorrect and did not fall within the criteria (i.e.   z  -score between\u2009±\u20091 and 5). Popularity and social preference (i.e. likability) scores were recalculated for the target images in these task versions. For one group of participants (n\u2009=\u200920), there were a sufficient number of target images that fit the criteria for each condition (High Popularity\u2009=\u20099, Low Popularity\u2009=\u20098, High Social Preference\u2009=\u20098, Low Social Preference\u2009=\u200910), so these participants were included, resulting in five groups of participants and study stimuli. For the other groups, there were an insufficient number of target images (e.g. as little as\xa05) in the conditions, so these participants (n\u2009=\u200915) were excluded. The faces in each condition were equally divided by female and male adolescents. We also attempted to build a racially/ethnically diverse paradigm such that each condition contains some faces representing individuals from minoritized groups. Research suggests that social preference (i.e. likability) and popularity are two distinct but correlated sociometric constructs in adolescents ( ). For our stimuli, the correlation between social preference and popularity scores ranged from 0.36 to 0.68 (Group 1:   r  \u2009=\u20090.36,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05; Group 2:   r  \u2009=\u20090.68,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001; Group 3:   r  \u2009=\u20090.56,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001; Group 4:   r  \u2009=\u20090.42,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01, Group 5:   r  \u2009=\u20090.46,   P  \u2009<\u20090.005). The correlation between social preference and popularity scores in the larger dataset from which study stimuli were drawn was 0.46,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001. Each target belonged in only one sociometric category and there was no overlap between targets in the social preference and popularity conditions. We did so to maximize the difference between neural responses to sociometric likability and popularity and increase the statistical power in our analyses. No adolescent participants in this neuroimaging study were included as face stimuli. The average   z  -score within each condition was approximately 2 (absolute value; see  ). We ensured equal distributions of sociometric scores across schools and conditions for the stimuli. \n\nThe Classmates task consisted of 16 blocks, four blocks per condition, presented across two runs. The blocks were presented in a randomized order. Within each block, there were 10 targets chosen to comprise that condition. Peer faces within each block were shown in a fixed order using a randomization algorithm. Participants saw each face 4 times total (2 in each run), with each condition having 40 total trials each. To achieve the power for neuroimaging analysis on visual stimuli, we repeated each peer face across the conditions, in line with previous studies (e.g.  ;  ). We used a 1-back task to ensure that adolescent participants were paying attention to these visual stimuli during scanning, such that each block contained one target that appeared twice in a row. In addition, implicit inferences of social attributes from faces often require face identity recognition processes ( ,  ). A large body of work has shown that 1-back paradigms successfully elicit face identity recognition processes in which participants invoke a mental representation of face identity in the absence of percept ( ;  ;  ). Participants were instructed to press a button with their right pointer finger when a face repeated. Adolescents were not explicitly told to track peer status, which allows us to investigate how the brain spontaneously supports adolescents’ awareness of peer-based social hierarchies in real-world networks. Each face was shown for 1750\u2009ms, and a fixation cross was jittered around an average of 2301\u2009ms (range: 565.8–4936.8\u2009ms; see\xa0 ). We did not include a control condition (e.g. teenagers with equal social attributes from other social networks) to account for other social attributes as it may regress out the phenomenon of our research interest, given that other social attributes (e.g. facial attractiveness, trustworthiness) are inherently correlated with social status in humans ( ).
