    "abstract": " \nEpisodic memory retrieval is associated with the holistic neocortical reinstatement of all event information, an effect driven by hippocampal pattern completion. However, whether holistic reinstatement occurs, and whether hippocampal pattern completion continues to drive reinstatement, after a period of consolidation is unclear. Theories of systems consolidation predict either a time-variant or time-invariant role of the hippocampus in the holistic retrieval of episodic events. Here, we assessed whether episodic events continue to be reinstated holistically and whether hippocampal pattern completion continues to facilitate holistic reinstatement following a period of consolidation. Female and male human participants learned \u201cevents\u201d that comprised multiple overlapping pairs of event elements (e.g., person\u2013location, object\u2013location, location\u2013person). Importantly, encoding occurred either immediately before or 24\u2005h before retrieval. Using fMRI during the retrieval of events, we show evidence for holistic reinstatement, as well as a correlation between reinstatement and hippocampal pattern completion, regardless of whether retrieval occurred immediately or 24\u2005h after encoding. Thus, hippocampal pattern completion continues to contribute to holistic reinstatement after a delay. However, our results also revealed that some holistic reinstatement can occur without evidence for a corresponding signature of hippocampal pattern completion after a delay (but not immediately after encoding). We therefore show that hippocampal pattern completion, in addition to a nonhippocampal process, has a role in holistic reinstatement following a period of consolidation. Our results point to a consolidation process where the hippocampus and neocortex may work in an additive, rather than compensatory, manner to support episodic memory retrieval. \n ",
