The regions are shown in Fig. 2. There is similar activity between the early time point in the control group and the late time point in the PTSD group in all regions. There is also similar activity between the late time point in the control group and the early time point in the PTSD group in all regions. This suggests that a similar neural network underlies involuntary memory retrieval in PTSD and controls with the difference being the time that it peaks.", "table_foot": "All df\u202f=\u202f40 except in the comparison between control early and PTSD late, the df\u202f=\u202f39.89.", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_004.csv"}
